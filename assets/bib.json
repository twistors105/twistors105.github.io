  {"id":"2022","abstract":"In physics, the Rabi cycle (or Rabi flop) is the cyclic behaviour of a two-level quantum system in the presence of an oscillatory driving field. A great variety of physical processes belonging to the areas of quantum computing, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, and nuclear and particle physics can be conveniently studied in terms of two-level quantum mechanical systems, and exhibit Rabi flopping when coupled to an oscillatory driving field. The effect is important in quantum optics, magnetic resonance and quantum computing, and is named after Isidor Isaac Rabi.\nA two-level system is one that has two possible energy levels. These two levels are a ground state with lower energy and an excited state with higher energy. If the energy levels are not degenerate (i.e. not having equal energies), the system can absorb a quantum of energy and transition from the ground state to the \"excited\" state. When an atom (or some other two-level system) is illuminated by a coherent beam of photons, it will cyclically absorb photons and re-emit them by stimulated emission. One such cycle is called a Rabi cycle, and the inverse of its duration is the Rabi frequency of the photon beam. The effect can be modeled using the Jaynes–Cummings model and the Bloch vector formalism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,21]]},"citation-key":"2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,2]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1069496775","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Rabi cycle","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rabi_cycle&oldid=1069496775"},
  {"id":"2022a","abstract":"In quantum mechanics, identical particles (also called indistinguishable or indiscernible particles) are particles that cannot be distinguished from one another, even in principle. Species of identical particles include, but are not limited to, elementary particles (such as electrons), composite subatomic particles (such as atomic nuclei), as well as atoms and molecules. Quasiparticles also behave in this way. Although all known indistinguishable particles only exist at the quantum scale, there is no exhaustive list of all possible sorts of particles nor a clear-cut limit of applicability, as explored in quantum statistics.\nThere are two main categories of identical particles: bosons, which can share quantum states, and fermions, which cannot (as described by the Pauli exclusion principle). Examples of bosons are photons, gluons, phonons, helium-4 nuclei and all mesons. Examples of fermions are electrons, neutrinos, quarks, protons, neutrons, and helium-3 nuclei.\nThe fact that particles can be identical has important consequences in statistical mechanics, where calculations rely on probabilistic arguments, which are sensitive to whether or not the objects being studied are identical. As a result, identical particles exhibit markedly different statistical behaviour from distinguishable particles. For example, the indistinguishability of particles has been proposed as a solution to Gibbs' mixing paradox.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,24]]},"citation-key":"2022a","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1071258632","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Identical particles","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Identical_particles&oldid=1071258632"},

In general, the operation of exchanging two identical particles, although it may cause a global phase shift, cannot affect observables. Anyons are generally classified as abelian or non-abelian. Abelian anyons (detected by two experiments in 2020) play a major role in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

  {"id":"2022e","abstract":"Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about the Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (for example, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.\nIn current usage, the term \"remote sensing\" generally refers to the use of satellite or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into \"active\" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection detected by the sensor) and \"passive\" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).Schowengerdt, Robert A.

  {"id":"2022k","abstract":"The Wigner quasiprobability distribution (also called the Wigner function or the Wigner–Ville distribution, after Eugene Wigner and Jean-André Ville) is a quasiprobability distribution. It was introduced by Eugene Wigner in 1932 to study quantum corrections to classical statistical mechanics. The goal was to link the wavefunction that appears in Schrödinger's equation to a probability distribution in phase space.\nIt is a generating function for all spatial autocorrelation functions of a given quantum-mechanical wavefunction ψ(x).\nThus, it maps on the quantum density matrix in the map between real phase-space functions and Hermitian operators introduced by Hermann Weyl in 1927, in a context related to representation theory in mathematics (see Weyl quantization). In effect, it is the Wigner–Weyl transform of the density matrix, so the realization of that operator in phase space. It was later rederived by Jean Ville in 1948 as a quadratic (in signal) representation of the local time-frequency energy of a signal, effectively a spectrogram.\nIn 1949, José Enrique Moyal, who had derived it independently, recognized it as the quantum moment-generating functional, and thus as the basis of an elegant encoding of all quantum expectation values, and hence quantum mechanics, in phase space (see Phase-space formulation). It has applications in statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, quantum optics, classical optics and signal analysis in diverse fields, such as electrical engineering, seismology, time–frequency analysis for music signals, spectrograms in biology and speech processing, and engine design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"citation-key":"2022k","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,21]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1117475338","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Wigner quasiprobability distribution","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wigner_quasiprobability_distribution&oldid=1117475338"},

  {"id":"2023a","abstract":"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), usually simply called neural networks (NNs) or neural nets, are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal to other neurons. An artificial neuron receives signals then processes them and can signal neurons connected to it. The \"signal\" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Neurons may have a threshold such that a signal is sent only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.\n\nTypically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer), to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"citation-key":"2023a","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1142333251","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Artificial neural network","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artificial_neural_network&oldid=1142333251"},

This enables simple closed form statements to be made about neural network predictions, training dynamics, generalization, and loss surfaces. For example, it guarantees that wide enough ANNs converge to a global minimum when trained to minimize an empirical loss.

  {"id":"2023e","abstract":"Hebbian theory is a neuropsychology theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:\n\nLet us assume that the persistence or repetition of a reverberatory activity (or \"trace\") tends to induce lasting cellular changes that add to its stability. ... When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased.\nThe theory is often summarized as \"Cells that fire together wire together.\" However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to \"take part in firing\" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"citation-key":"2023e","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,27]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1141917257","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Hebbian theory","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hebbian_theory&oldid=1141917257"},

This means that a geometric shape, such as , that moves continuously along such a loop is changed into its own mirror image . A Möbius strip is an example of a non-orientable space.\nVarious equivalent formulations of orientability can be given, depending on the desired application and level of generality. Formulations applicable to general topological manifolds often employ methods of homology theory, whereas for differentiable manifolds more structure is present, allowing a formulation in terms of differential forms.

It is a theory in theoretical computer science with close connections to mathematical logic. The word automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματος, which means \"self-acting, self-willed, self-moving\". An automaton (automata in plural) is an abstract self-propelled computing device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. An automaton with a finite number of states is called a Finite Automaton (FA) or Finite-State Machine (FSM). The figure on the right illustrates a finite-state machine, which is a well-known type of automaton.  This automaton consists of states (represented in the figure by circles) and transitions (represented by arrows).  As the automaton sees a symbol of input, it makes a transition (or jump) to another state, according to its transition function, which takes the previous state and current input symbol as its arguments.\nAutomata theory is closely related to formal language theory. In this context, automata are used as finite representations of formal languages that may be infinite. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, as in the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes a nesting relationship between major classes of automata. Automata play a major role in the theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,17]]},"citation-key":"2023n","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,5]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1173909383","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Automata theory","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Automata_theory&oldid=1173909383"},

A key example of this phenomenon is the spin–orbit interaction leading to shifts in an electron's atomic energy levels,  due to electromagnetic interaction between the electron's magnetic dipole, its orbital motion, and the electrostatic field of the positively charged nucleus. This phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of spectral lines, which can be thought of as a Zeeman effect product of two relativistic effects: the apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic moment of the electron associated with its intrinsic spin.  A similar effect, due to the relationship between angular momentum and the strong nuclear force, occurs for protons and neutrons moving inside the nucleus, leading to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus shell model. In the field of spintronics, spin–orbit effects for electrons in semiconductors and other materials are explored for technological applications. The spin–orbit interaction is at the origin of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the spin Hall effect.\nFor atoms, energy level splitting produced by the spin–orbit interaction is usually of the same order in size as the relativistic corrections to the kinetic energy and the zitterbewegung effect. The addition of these three corrections is known as the fine structure. The interaction between the magnetic field created by the electron and the magnetic moment of the nucleus is a slighter correction to the energy levels known as the hyperfine structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,30]]},"citation-key":"2023u","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,21]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1191152094","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Spin–orbit interaction","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spin%E2%80%93orbit_interaction&oldid=1191152094"},

  {"id":"2024d","abstract":"In probability, statistics and related fields, a Poisson point process is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space with the essential feature that the points occur independently of one another. The Poisson point process is also called a Poisson random measure, Poisson random point field or Poisson point field. When the process is defined on the real line, it is often called simply the Poisson process.\nThis point process has convenient mathematical properties, which has led to its being frequently defined in Euclidean space and used as a mathematical model for seemingly random processes in numerous disciplines such as astronomy, biology, ecology, geology, seismology, physics, economics, image processing, and telecommunications.The process is named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson despite Poisson's never having studied the process. Its name derives from the fact that if a collection of random points in some space forms a Poisson process, then the number of points in a region of finite size is a random variable with a Poisson distribution.  The process was discovered independently and repeatedly in several settings, including experiments on radioactive decay, telephone call arrivals and insurance mathematics.The Poisson point process is often defined on the real line, where it can be considered as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store, phone calls at an exchange or occurrence of earthquakes, distributed in time.  In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest. In this setting, the process is often used in mathematical models and in the related fields of spatial point processes, stochastic geometry, spatial statistics and continuum percolation theory. The Poisson point process can be defined on more abstract spaces. Beyond applications, the Poisson point process is an object of mathematical study in its own right. In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. Modeling a system as a Poisson Process is insufficient when the point-to-point interactions are too strong (i.e. the points are not stochastically independent). Such a system may be better modeled with a different point process.The point process depends on a single mathematical object, which, depending on the context, may be a constant, a locally integrable function or, in more general settings, a Radon measure. In the first case, the constant, known as the rate or intensity, is the average density of the points in the Poisson process located in some region of space. The resulting point process is called a homogeneous  or stationary Poisson point process. In the second case, the point process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson point process, and the average density of points depend on the location of the underlying space of the Poisson point process. The word point is often omitted, but there are other Poisson processes of objects, which, instead of points, consist of more complicated mathematical objects such as lines and polygons, and such processes can be based on the Poisson point process. Both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous Poisson point processes are particular cases of the generalized renewal process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"citation-key":"2024d","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1204284017","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Poisson point process","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Poisson_point_process&oldid=1204284017"},

  {"id":"2024l","abstract":"In quantum physics, a quantum fluctuation (also known as a vacuum state fluctuation or vacuum fluctuation) is the temporary random change in the amount of energy in a point in space, as prescribed by Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. They are minute random fluctuations in the values of the fields which represent elementary particles, such as electric and magnetic fields which represent the electromagnetic force carried by photons, W and Z fields which carry the weak force, and gluon fields which carry the strong force.\nThe uncertainty principle states the uncertainty in energy and time can be related by \n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        E\n        \n        Δ\n        t\n        ≥\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              2\n            \n          \n        \n        ℏ\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta E\\,\\Delta t\\geq {\\tfrac {1}{2}}\\hbar ~}\n  \n, where 1/2ħ ≈  5.27286×10−35 Js.

Although the particles are not directly detectable, the cumulative effects of these particles are measurable. For example, without quantum fluctuations, the \"bare\" mass and charge of elementary particles would be infinite; from renormalization theory the shielding effect of the cloud of virtual particles is responsible for the finite mass and charge of elementary particles.  \nAnother consequence is the Casimir effect. One of the first observations which was evidence for vacuum fluctuations was the Lamb shift in hydrogen. In July 2020, scientists reported that quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence the motion of macroscopic, human-scale objects by measuring correlations below the standard quantum limit between the position/momentum uncertainty of the mirrors of LIGO and the photon number/phase uncertainty of light that they reflect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,18]]},"citation-key":"2024l","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1227657997","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Quantum fluctuation","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quantum_fluctuation&oldid=1227657997"},

The quantum operation formalism describes not only unitary time evolution or symmetry transformations of isolated systems, but also the effects of measurement and transient interactions with an environment. In the context of quantum computation, a quantum operation is called a quantum channel.\nNote that some authors use the term \"quantum operation\" to refer specifically to completely positive (CP) and non-trace-increasing maps on the space of density matrices, and the term \"quantum channel\" to refer to the subset of those that are strictly trace-preserving.\nQuantum operations are formulated in terms of the density operator description of a quantum mechanical system.  Rigorously, a quantum operation is a linear, completely positive map from the set of density operators into itself.

  {"id":"aaronson2004","abstract":"The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit -- that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a \"canonical form\" that requires at most O(n^2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Aaronson","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Gottesman","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"aaronson2004","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

Starting from the $SU(N)$ gauge theory with the 't~Hooft twisted boundary condition, we give a simpler explanation of the van~Baal's proof on the fractionality of the topological charge. This description is applicable to both continuum and lattice by using the generalized L\\\"uscher's construction of topology on the lattice. Thus we can recover the $SU(N)/\\mathbb{Z}_N$ principal bundle from lattice $SU(N)$ gauge fields being subject to the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-relaxed cocycle condition.

By an analysis that explicitly incorporates the energy reservoir that donates the energy and the control system that implements the dynamic, we obtain a quantum generalization of Crooks theorem that not only includes the energy changes in the reservoir but also the full description of its evolution, including coherences. Moreover, this approach opens up the possibility for generalizations of the concept of fluctuation relations.

  {"id":"abramsky2012a","abstract":"Bell inequalities play a central role in the study of quantum non-locality and entanglement, with many applications in quantum information. Despite the huge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual answer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how they may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell inequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for a very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual principle, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our notion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell inequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It applies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers not only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly applied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There is much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach directly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very general notion of contextuality. There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without inequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a sense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On the hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach reconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be converted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable violations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality exhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown to lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Abramsky","given":"Samson"},{"family":"Hardy","given":"Lucien"}],"citation-key":"abramsky2012a","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"adil2024","abstract":"Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the \"pointer states\") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical \"realms\" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Adil","given":"Arsalan"},{"family":"Rudolph","given":"Manuel S."},{"family":"Arrasmith","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Holmes","given":"Zoë"},{"family":"Albrecht","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Sornborger","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"adil2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2403.10895","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,16]]},"number":"arXiv:2403.10895","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10895"},

  {"id":"adler2009","abstract":"Since the term “random ?eld’’ has a variety of different connotations, ranging from agriculture to statistical mechanics, let us start by clarifying that, in this book, a random ?eld is a stochastic process, usually taking values in a Euclidean space, and de?ned over a parameter space of dimensionality at least 1. Consequently, random processes de?ned on countable parameter spaces will not 1 appear here. Indeed, even processes on R will make only rare appearances and, from the point of view of this book, are almost trivial. The parameter spaces we like best are manifolds, although for much of the time we shall require no more than that they be pseudometric spaces. With this clari?cation in hand, the next thing that you should know is that this book will have a sequel dealing primarily with applications. In fact, as we complete this book, we have already started, together with KW (Keith Worsley), on a companion volume [8] tentatively entitled RFG-A,or Random Fields and Geometry: Applications. The current volume—RFG—concentrates on the theory and mathematical background of random ?elds, while RFG-A is intended to do precisely what its title promises.

  {"id":"aharonov2017","abstract":"The widely held belief that BQP strictly contains BPP raises fundamental questions: if we cannot efficiently compute predictions for the behavior of quantum systems, how can we test their behavior? In other words, is quantum mechanics falsifiable? In cryptographic settings, how can a customer of a future untrusted quantum computing company be convinced of the correctness of its quantum computations? To provide answers to these questions, we define Quantum Prover Interactive Proofs (QPIP). Whereas in standard interactive proofs the prover is computationally unbounded, here our prover is in BQP, representing a quantum computer. The verifier models our current computational capabilities: it is a BPP machine, with access to only a few qubits. Our main theorem states, roughly: 'Any language in BQP has a QPIP, which also hides the computation from the prover'. We provide two proofs, one based on a quantum authentication scheme (QAS) relying on random Clifford rotations and the other based on a QAS which uses polynomial codes (BOCG+ 06), combined with secure multiparty computation methods. This is the journal version of work reported in 2008 (ABOE08) and presented in ICS 2010; here we have completed the details and made the proofs rigorous. Some of the proofs required major modifications and corrections. Notably, the claim that the polynomial QPIP is fault tolerant was removed. Similar results (with different protocols) were reported independently around the same time of the original version in BFK08. The initial independent works (ABOE08, BFK08) ignited a long line of research of blind verifiable quantum computation, which we survey here, along with connections to various cryptographic problems. Importantly, the problems of making the results fault tolerant as well as removing the need for quantum communication altogether remain open.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Aharonov","given":"Dorit"},{"family":"Ben-Or","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Eban","given":"Elad"},{"family":"Mahadev","given":"Urmila"}],"citation-key":"aharonov2017","container-title":"arXiv:1704.04487 [quant-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,14]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Interactive Proofs for Quantum Computations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04487"},

  {"id":"albayrak2023","abstract":"Unitarity of time evolution is one of the basic principles constraining physical processes. Its consequences in the perturbative Bunch-Davies wavefunction in cosmology have been formulated in terms of the cosmological optical theorem. In this paper, we re-analyse perturbative unitarity for the Bunch-Davies wavefunction, focusing on: 1) the role of the $i\\epsilon$-prescription and its compatibility with the requirement of unitarity; 2) the origin of the different \"cutting rules\"; 3) the emergence of the flat-space optical theorem from the cosmological one. We take the combinatorial point of view of the cosmological polytopes, which provide a first-principle description for a large class of scalar graphs contributing to the wavefunctional. The requirement of the positivity of the geometry together with the preservation of its orientation determine the $i\\epsilon$-prescription. In kinematic space it translates into giving a small negative imaginary part to all the energies, making the wavefunction coefficients well-defined for any value of their real part along the real axis. Unitarity is instead encoded into a non-convex part of the cosmological polytope, which we name optical polytope. The cosmological optical theorem emerges as the equivalence between a specific polytope subdivision of the optical polytope and its triangulations, each of which provides different cutting rules. The flat-space optical theorem instead emerges from the non-convexity of the optical polytope. On the more mathematical side, we provide two definitions of this non-convex geometry, none of them based on the idea of the non-convex geometry as a union of convex ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Albayrak","given":"Soner"},{"family":"Benincasa","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Pueyo","given":"Carlos Duaso"}],"citation-key":"albayrak2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2305.19686","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,31]]},"number":"arXiv:2305.19686","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Perturbative Unitarity and the Wavefunction of the Universe","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19686"},

Such wires can be driven into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can encode topological qubits. We show that in wire networks, Majorana fermions can be meaningfully braided by simply adjusting gate voltages, and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+i p superconductor. We propose experimental set-ups that enable probing of the Majorana fusion rules and the efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions.

We circumvent the problem by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities. This allows us to train the QBM efficiently by sampling. We show examples of QBM training with and without the bound, using exact diagonalization, and compare the results with classical Boltzmann training. We also discuss the possibility of using quantum annealing processors like D-Wave for QBM training and application.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Amin","given":"Mohammad H."},{"family":"Andriyash","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Rolfe","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Kulchytskyy","given":"Bohdan"},{"family":"Melko","given":"Roger"}],"citation-key":"amin2018","container-title":"Physical Review X","container-title-short":"Phys.

This book will familiarize students with various applications of probability theory, stochastic modeling and random processes, using examples from all these disciplines and more. The reader learns via case studies and begins to recognize the sort of problems that are best tackled probabilistically. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding, the development of intuition and gaining insight, keeping technicalities to a minimum. Nevertheless, a glimpse into the depth of the topics is provided, preparing students for more specialized texts while assuming only an undergraduate-level background in mathematics. The wide range of areas covered - never before discussed together in a unified fashion – includes Markov processes and random walks, Langevin and Fokker–Planck equations, noise, generalized central limit theorem and extreme values statistics, random matrix theory and percolation theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Amir","given":"Ariel"}],"citation-key":"amir2020","DOI":"10.1017/9781108855259","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-108-85525-9 978-1-108-47952-3 978-1-108-78998-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,31]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Thinking Probabilistically: Stochastic Processes, Disordered Systems, and Their Applications","title-short":"Thinking Probabilistically","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781108855259/type/book"},

  {"id":"amy2022","abstract":"Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with applications to the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum protocols. Unlike quantum circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary operations, but can express arbitrary linear ones. Two problems, therefore, naturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator. We show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is in P when restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an algorithm to synthesize a Clifford circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum. The circuits produced by our extraction algorithm are of the form $C_1HC_2$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are Hadamard-free circuits and $H$ is a layer of Hadamard gates. We also provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to arbitrary path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it often succeeds and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside applications to the optimization and decompilation of quantum circuits, we demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by synthesizing the standard quantum Fourier transform directly from a path sum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Amy","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Bennett-Gibbs","given":"Owen"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Neil J."}],"citation-key":"amy2022","container-title":"arXiv:2204.14205 [quant-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Symbolic synthesis of Clifford circuits and beyond","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14205"},
  {"id":"anastopoulos2023","abstract":"This is the first in a series of papers aiming to develop a relativistic quantum information theory in terms of unequal-time correlation functions in quantum field theory. In this work, we highlight two formalisms which together can provide a useful theoretical platform suitable for further developments: (1) Quantum field measurements using the Quantum Temporal Probabilities (QTP) method; (2) Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for causal time evolutions. QTP incorporates the detector into the quantum description, while emphasizing that the records of measurement are macroscopic and can be expressed in terms of classical spacetime coordinates. We first present a new, elementary derivation of the QTP formulas for the probabilities of n measurement events. We then demonstrate the relation of QTP with the Closed-Time-Path formalism, by writing an explicit formula that relates the associated generating functionals. We exploit the path integral representation of the CTP formalism, in order to express the measured probabilities in terms of path integrals. After this, we provide some simple applications of the QTP formalism. In particular, we show how Unruh–DeWitt detector models and Glauber’s photodetection theory appear as limiting cases. Finally, with quantum correlation being the pivotal notion in relativistic quantum information and measurements, we highlight the role played by the CTP two-particle irreducible effective action which enables one to tap into the resources of non-equilibrium quantum field theory for our stated purpose.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Anastopoulos","given":"Charis"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Bei-Lok"},{"family":"Savvidou","given":"Konstantina"}],"citation-key":"anastopoulos2023","container-title":"Annals of Physics","container-title-short":"Annals of Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.aop.2023.169239","ISSN":"0003-4916","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"page":"169239","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Quantum field theory based quantum information: Measurements and correlations","title-short":"Quantum field theory based quantum information","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491623000246","volume":"450"},

  {"id":"andersen2023","abstract":"Indistinguishability of particles is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics1. For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date—including fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons—this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged2,3. However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions4–8. Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well-developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals9–22, the experimental observation of their exchange statistics has remained elusive for decades. Controllable many-body quantum states generated on quantum processors offer another path for exploring these fundamental phenomena. Whereas efforts on conventional solid-state platforms typically involve Hamiltonian dynamics of quasiparticles, superconducting quantum processors allow for directly manipulating the many-body wavefunction by means of unitary gates. Building on predictions that stabilizer codes can host projective non-Abelian Ising anyons9,10, we implement a generalized stabilizer code and unitary protocol23 to create and braid them. This allows us to experimentally verify the fusion rules of the anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. We then study the prospect of using the anyons for quantum computation and use braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work provides new insights about non-Abelian braiding and, through the future inclusion of error correction to achieve topological protection, could open a path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"T.

The importance of non-unitary transformations for constructing solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation is discussed. Three elementary canonical transformations are shown both to have quantum implementations as finite transformations and to generate, classically and infinitesimally, the full canonical algebra. A general canonical transformation can be realized quantum mechanically as a product of these transformations. Each transformation corresponds to a familiar tool used in solving differential equations, and the procedure of solving a differential equation is systematized by the use of the canonical transformations.

A material particle crossing the event horizon falls into a central singularity according to the classical theory of general relativity. In the quantum theory of gravity, there may be no central singularity. The physics of the event horizon is currently being refined.

  {"id":"arabadjieva2024","abstract":"A proof of quantumness is an efficiently verifiable interactive test that an efficient quantum computer can pass, but all efficient classical computers cannot (under some cryptographic assumption). Such protocols play a crucial role in the certification of quantum devices. Existing single-round protocols (like asking the quantum computer to factor a large number) require large quantum circuits, whereas multi-round ones use smaller circuits but require experimentally challenging mid-circuit measurements. As such, current proofs of quantumness are out of reach for near-term devices. In this work, we construct efficient single-round proofs of quantumness based on existing knowledge assumptions. While knowledge assumptions have not been previously considered in this context, we show that they provide a natural basis for separating classical and quantum computation. Specifically, we show that multi-round protocols based on Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) or Learning With Errors (LWE) can be \"compiled\" into single-round protocols using a knowledge-of-exponent assumption or knowledge-of-lattice-point assumption, respectively. We also prove an adaptive hardcore-bit statement for a family of claw-free functions based on DDH, which might be of independent interest. Previous approaches to constructing single-round protocols relied on the random oracle model and thus incurred the overhead associated with instantiating the oracle with a cryptographic hash function. In contrast, our protocols have the same resource requirements as their multi-round counterparts without necessitating mid-circuit measurements, making them, arguably, the most efficient single-round proofs of quantumness to date. Our work also helps in understanding the interplay between black-box/white-box reductions and cryptographic assumptions in the design of proofs of quantumness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Arabadjieva","given":"Petia"},{"family":"Gheorghiu","given":"Alexandru"},{"family":"Gitton","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Metger","given":"Tony"}],"citation-key":"arabadjieva2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,24]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.15736","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Single-Round Proofs of Quantumness from Knowledge Assumptions","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15736"},

  {"id":"arrazola2021","abstract":"Growing interest in quantum computing for practical applications has led to a surge in the availability of programmable machines for executing quantum algorithms1,2. Present-day photonic quantum computers3–7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8. These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Arrazola","given":"J.

We provide an overview of fundamental concepts in quantum chemistry, including the basic principles of the Hartree-Fock method. A flagship feature in PennyLane is the differentiable Hartree-Fock solver, allowing users to compute exact gradients of molecular Hamiltonians with respect to nuclear coordinates and basis set parameters. PennyLane provides specialized operations for quantum chemistry, including excitation gates as Givens rotations and templates for quantum chemistry circuits. Moreover, built-in simulators exploit sparse matrix techniques for representing molecular Hamiltonians that lead to fast simulation for quantum chemistry applications. In combination with PennyLane's existing methods for constructing, optimizing, and executing circuits, these methods allow users to implement a wide range of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. We discuss how PennyLane can be used to implement variational algorithms for calculating ground-state energies, excited-state energies, and energy derivatives, all of which can be differentiated with respect to both circuit and Hamiltonian parameters. We provide an example workflow describing how to jointly optimize circuit parameters, nuclear coordinates, and basis set parameters for quantum chemistry algorithms. We discuss a functionality for reducing the number of qubits by using symmetries and explain how PennyLane can be used to estimate quantum resources needed to implement several quantum algorithms. By combining insights from quantum computing, computational chemistry, and machine learning, PennyLane is the first library for differentiable quantum computational chemistry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Arrazola","given":"Juan Miguel"},{"family":"Jahangiri","given":"Soran"},{"family":"Delgado","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Ceroni","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Izaac","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Száva","given":"Antal"},{"family":"Azad","given":"Utkarsh"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Niu","given":"Zeyue"},{"family":"Di Matteo","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Moyard","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Soni","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Schuld","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Vargas-Hernández","given":"Rodrigo A."},{"family":"Tamayo-Mendoza","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Cedric Yen-Yu"},{"family":"Aspuru-Guzik","given":"Alán"},{"family":"Killoran","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"arrazola2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2111.09967","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,5]]},"number":"arXiv:2111.09967","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Differentiable quantum computational chemistry with PennyLane","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09967"},

  {"id":"ashtekar2023","abstract":"There is rich literature on regular black holes from loop quantum gravity (LQG), where quantum geometry effects resolve the singularity, leading to a quantum extension of the classical space-time. As we will see, the mechanism that resolves the singularity can also trigger conceptually undesirable features that can be subtle and are often uncovered only after a detailed examination. Therefore, the quantization scheme has to be chosen rather astutely. We illustrate the new physics that emerges first in the context of the eternal black hole represented by the Kruskal space-time in classical general relativity, then in dynamical situations involving gravitational collapse, and finally, during the Hawking evaporation process. The emphasis is on novel conceptual features associated with the causal structure, trapping and anti-trapping horizons and boundedness of invariants associated with curvature and matter. This Chapter is not intended to be an exhaustive account of all LQG results on non-singular black holes. Rather, we have selected a few main-stream thrusts to anchor the discussion, and provided references where further details as well as discussions of related developments can be found.

  {"id":"aspling2024","abstract":"A set of universal quantum gates is a vital part of the theory of quantum computing, but is absent in the developing theory of Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). Yet, the Unruh--DeWitt (UDW) detector formalism can be elevated to unitary gates between qubits and quantum fields and has allowed RQI applications in quantum Shannon theory, such as mutual information, coherent information, and quantum capacity in field-mediated quantum channels. Recently, experimental realizations of UDW-style qubits have been proposed in two-dimensional quantum materials, but their value as a quantum technology, including quantum communication and computation, is not yet clear, especially since fields introduce many avenues for decoherence. We introduce controlled-unitary UDW logic gates between qubit and field that are comparable to the two-qubit CNOT gate. We then extend this formalism to demonstrate Quantum State Transfer (QST) (two CNOT gates) and SWAP (three CNOT gates) channels. We illustrate the performance of these quantum operation gates with the diamond distance, a measure of distinguishability between quantum channels. Distinguishability measures like diamond distance allow for a rigorous comparison between field-mediated transduction through UDW detectors and local quantum mechanical operations and so quantify the performance of UDW detectors in quantum technological applications. Using the controlled-unitary qubit-field interactions we define an exact form of the CNOT gate. With this technique we also define quantum field-mediated single qubit operations associated with the Hadamard $H$, the $S$, and $T$ gates. Thus, UDW detectors in simple settings enable a collection of gates known to provide universal quantum computing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Aspling","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Lawler","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"aspling2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"number":"arXiv:2402.10173","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Universal Quantum Computing with Field-Mediated Unruh--DeWitt Qubits","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10173"},

A variational pulse-shaping algorithm known as ctrl-VQE was recently proposed to address this issue by eliminating the need for parameterized quantum circuits, which lead to long state preparation times. Here, we find the shortest possible pulses for ctrl-VQE to prepare target molecular wavefunctions for a given device Hamiltonian describing coupled transmon qubits. We find that the time-optimal pulses that do this have a bang-bang form consistent with Pontryagin's maximum principle. We further investigate how the minimal state preparation time is impacted by truncating the transmons to two versus more levels. We find that leakage outside the computational subspace (something that is usually considered problematic) speeds up the state preparation, further reducing device coherence-time demands. This speedup is due to an enlarged solution space of target wavefunctions and to the appearance of additional channels connecting initial and target states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Asthana","given":"Ayush"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chenxu"},{"family":"Meitei","given":"Oinam Romesh"},{"family":"Economou","given":"Sophia E."},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Edwin"},{"family":"Mayhall","given":"Nicholas J."}],"citation-key":"asthana2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2203.06818","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,13]]},"number":"arXiv:2203.06818","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Minimizing state preparation times in pulse-level variational molecular simulations","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06818"},

The important insights we use to perform this construction are the selection of the appropriate subgroup adapted basis and the Wigner-Eckart theorem.

  {"id":"baez2004","abstract":"General relativity may seem very different from quantum theory, but work on quantum gravity has revealed a deep analogy between the two. General relativity makes heavy use of the category nCob, whose objects are (n-1)-dimensional manifolds representing \"space\" and whose morphisms are n-dimensional cobordisms representing \"spacetime\". Quantum theory makes heavy use of the category Hilb, whose objects are Hilbert spaces used to describe \"states\", and whose morphisms are bounded linear operators used to describe \"processes\". Moreover, the categories nCob and Hilb resemble each other far more than either resembles Set, the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions. In particular, both Hilb and nCob but not Set are *-categories with a noncartesian monoidal structure. We show how this accounts for many of the famously puzzling features of quantum theory: the failure of local realism, the impossibility of duplicating quantum information, and so on. We argue that these features only seem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb as analogous to Set rather than nCob, so that quantum theory will make more sense when regarded as part of a theory of spacetime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Baez","given":"John C."}],"citation-key":"baez2004","container-title":"arXiv:quant-ph/0404040","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",4,13]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum Quandaries: a Category-Theoretic Perspective","title-short":"Quantum Quandaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404040"},

In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ‘cobordism’: a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum ﬁeld theory and ‘quantum topology’. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of ‘closed symmetric monoidal category’.

The proximal implicit solver consists of inner-outer iterations: the inner iterations approximate each implicit update step using a fast optimization algorithm, and the outer iterations solve the ODE system over time. The proximal implicit ODE solver guarantees superiority over explicit solvers in numerical stability and computational efficiency.

  {"id":"ball2022","abstract":"The theory of the strong force, quantum chromodynamics, describes the proton in terms of quarks and gluons. The proton is a state of two up quarks and one down quark bound by gluons, but quantum theory predicts that in addition there is an infinite number of quark–antiquark pairs. Both light and heavy quarks, whose mass is respectively smaller or bigger than the mass of the proton, are revealed inside the proton in high-energy collisions. However, it is unclear whether heavy quarks also exist as a part of the proton wavefunction, which is determined by non-perturbative dynamics and accordingly unknown: so-called intrinsic heavy quarks1. It has been argued for a long time that the proton could have a sizable intrinsic component of the lightest heavy quark, the charm quark. Innumerable efforts to establish intrinsic charm in the proton2 have remained inconclusive. Here we provide evidence for intrinsic charm by exploiting a high-precision determination of the quark–gluon content of the nucleon3 based on machine learning and a large experimental dataset. We disentangle the intrinsic charm component from charm–anticharm pairs arising from high-energy radiation4. We establish the existence of intrinsic charm at the 3-standard-deviation level, with a momentum distribution in remarkable agreement with model predictions1,5.We confirm these findings by comparing them to very recent data on Z-boson production with charm jets from the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment6.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ball","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Candido","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Cruz-Martinez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Forte","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Giani","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Hekhorn","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Kudashkin","given":"Kirill"},{"family":"Magni","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Rojo","given":"Juan"},{"literal":"The NNPDF Collaboration"}],"citation-key":"ball2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04998-2","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7923","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"7923","page":"483-487","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Evidence for intrinsic charm quarks in the proton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04998-2","volume":"608"},

In this paper we present explicitly the seven noncommutative spaces of time-, space- and light-like geodesics that can be constructed from the time-, space- and light- versions of the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e quantum symmetry in (3+1) dimensions. Remarkably enough, only for the light-like (or null-plane) $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e deformation the three types of noncommutative spaces of geodesics can be constructed, while for the time-like and space-like deformations both the quantum time-like and space-like geodesics can be defined, but not the light-like one. This obstruction comes from the constraint imposed by the coisotropy condition for the corresponding deformation with respect to the isotropy subalgebra associated to the given space of geodesics, since all these quantum spaces are constructed as quantizations of the corresponding classical coisotropic Poisson homogeneous spaces. The known quantum space of geodesics on the light cone is given by a five-dimensional homogeneous quadratic algebra, and the six nocommutative spaces of time-like and space-like geodesics are explicitly obtained as six-dimensional nonlinear algebras. Five out of these six spaces are here presented for the first time, and Darboux generators for all of them are found, thus showing that the quantum deformation parameter $\\kappa^{-1}$ plays exactly the same algebraic role on quantum geodesics as the Planck constant $\\hbar$ plays in the usual phase space description of quantum mechanics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ballesteros","given":"Angel"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Sagredo","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Herranz","given":"Francisco J."}],"citation-key":"ballesteros2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2208.05851","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2208.05851","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"All noncommutative spaces of $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e geodesics","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05851"},

So far, it has usually been thought that a change of the classical game setting appears to be unavoidable for getting the quantum advantages. However, we give an affirmative answer here, focusing on the decision-making process (we call ‘reasoning’) to generate the best strategy, which may occur internally, e.g., in the player’s brain. To show this, we consider a classical guessing game. We then define a one-player reasoning problem in the context of the decision-making theory, where the machinery processes are designed to simulate classical and quantum reasoning. In such settings, we present a scenario where a rational player is able to make better use of his/her weak preferences due to quantum reasoning, without any altering or resetting of the classically defined game. We also argue in further analysis that the quantum reasoning may make the player fail, and even make the situation worse, due to any inappropriate preferences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bang","given":"Jeongho"},{"family":"Ryu","given":"Junghee"},{"family":"Pawłowski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Ham","given":"Byoung S."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jinhyoung"}],"citation-key":"bang2016","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/srep21424","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,15]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"21424","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Quantum-mechanical machinery for rational decision-making in classical guessing game","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21424","volume":"6"},

In this work, we consider a financial setting where instead of by classical probabilities the market is described by a quantum density operator. This setting naturally leads to a new asset class, which we call quantum assets. Under the assumption that such assets have a price and can be traded, we develop an extended definition of arbitrage to quantify gains without the corresponding risk. Our main result is a quantum version of the first fundamental theorem of asset pricing. If and only if there is no arbitrage, there exists a risk-free density operator under which all assets are martingales. This density operator is used for the pricing of quantum derivatives.

Many properties of a monoidal category carry over to the stalks of its sheaf, including having a trace, having exponential objects, having dual objects, having limits of some shape, and the central idempotents forming a Boolean algebra.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbosa","given":"Rui Soares"},{"family":"Heunen","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"barbosa2023","container-title":"Advances in Mathematics","container-title-short":"Advances in Mathematics","DOI":"10.1016/j.aim.2023.108900","ISSN":"00018708","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"page":"108900","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Sheaf representation of monoidal categories","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08896","volume":"416"},
  {"id":"bard2022","abstract":"As the open-source and free alternative to expensive software like MapleTM, MathematicaR, and MATLABR, Sage offers anyone with a web browser the ability to use cutting-edge mathematical software and share the results with others, often with stunning graphics. This book is a gentle introduction to Sage for undergraduate students during Calculus II, Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Math Modeling, or Operations Research. The book assumes no background in programming, but the reader who finishes the book will have learned about 60 percent of a first semester computer science course, including much of the Python programming language. The audience is not only math majors, but also physics, engineering, environmental science, finance, chemistry, economics, data science, and computer science majors. Many of the book's examples are drawn from those fields. Filled with ``challenges'' for the students to test their progress, the book is also ideal for self-study. What's New in the Second Edition: In 2019, Sage transitioned from Python 2 to Python 3, which changed the syntax in several significant ways, including for the print command. All the examples in this book have been rewritten to be compatible with Python 3. Moreover, every code block longer than four lines has been placed in an archive on the book's website http://www.sage-for-undergraduates.org that is maintained by the author, so that the students won't have to retype the code! Other additions include ... The number of ``challenges'' for the students to test their own progress in learning Sage has roughly doubled, which will be a great boon for self-study.There's approximately 150 pages of new content, including: New projects on Leontief Input-Output Analysis and on Environmental ScienceNew sections about Complex Numbers and Complex Analysis, on SageTex, and on solving problems via Monte-Carlo Simulations.The first three sections of Chapter 1 have been completely rewritten to give absolute beginners a smoother transition into Sage.","author":[{"family":"Bard","given":"Gregory V."}],"citation-key":"bard2022","ISBN":"978-1-4704-6155-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"481","publisher":"American Mathematical Society","source":"Google Books","title":"Sage for Undergraduates: Compatible with Python 3","title-short":"Sage for Undergraduates","type":"book"},

However, it is an outstanding question whether control can be realized with low error. Only gates from the Clifford group—containing π, π/2, and Hadamard gates—have been characterized with high accuracy. Here, we show how the Platonic solids enable implementing and characterizing larger gate sets. We find that all gates can be implemented with low error. The results fundamentally imply arbitrary manipulation of the quantum state can be realized with high precision, providing practical possibilities for designing efficient quantum algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Barends","given":"R."},{"family":"Kelly","given":"J."},{"family":"Veitia","given":"A."},{"family":"Megrant","given":"A."},{"family":"Fowler","given":"A.

  {"id":"bars2001","abstract":"It is shown that Witten's star product in string field theory, defined as the overlap of half strings, is equivalent to the Moyal star product involving the relativistic phase space of even string modes. The string field ψA(xμ[σ]) can be rewritten as a phase space field of the even modes A(x2nμ,x0,p2nμ), where x2nμ are the positions of the even string modes, and p2nμ are related to the Fourier space of the odd modes x2n+1μ up to a linear transformation. The p2nμ play the role of conjugate momenta for the even modes x2nμ under the string star product. The split string formalism is used in the intermediate steps to establish the map from Witten's ★-product to Moyal's ★-star product. An ambiguity related to the midpoint in the split string formalism is clarified by considering odd or even modding for the split string modes, and its effect in the Moyal star product formalism is discussed. The noncommutative geometry defined in this way is technically similar to the one that occurs in noncommutative field theory, but it includes the timelike components of the string modes, and is Lorentz invariant. This map could be useful to extend the computational methods and concepts from noncommutative field theory to string field theory and vice versa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bars","given":"Itzhak"}],"citation-key":"bars2001","container-title":"Physics Letters B","container-title-short":"Physics Letters B","DOI":"10.1016/S0370-2693(01)00908-X","ISSN":"0370-2693","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",10,4]]},"language":"en","page":"436-444","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Map of Witten's ★ to Moyal's ★","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037026930100908X","volume":"517"},

Through detailed computations, such as Neumann coefficients for all string vertices, we show that the Moyal star product is all that is needed to give a precise definition of string field theory. The formulation of the theory as well as the computation techniques are considerably simpler in the Moyal formulation. After identifying a monoid algebra as a fundamental mathematical structure in string field theory, we use it as a tool to compute with ease the field configurations for wedge, sliver, and generalized projectors, as well as all the string interaction vertices for perturbative as well as monoid-type nonperturbative states. Finally, in the context of VSFT we analyze the small fluctuations around any D-brane vacuum. We show quite generally that to obtain nontrivial mass and coupling, as well as a closed strings, there must be an associativity anomaly.

  {"id":"bars2014","abstract":"We develop a new background independent Moyal star formalism in bosonic open string field theory. The new star product is formulated in a half-phase-space, and because phase space is independent of any background fields, the interactions are background independent. In this basis there is a large amount of symmetry, including a supersymmetry OSp(d|2) that acts on matter and ghost degrees of freedom, and simplifies computations. The BRST operator that defines the quadratic kinetic term of string field theory may be regarded as the solution of the equation of motion A*A=0 of a purely cubic background independent string field theory. We find an infinite number of non-perturbative solutions to this equation, and are able to associate them to the BRST operator of conformal field theories on the worldsheet. Thus, the background emerges from a spontaneous-type breaking of a purely cubic highly symmetric theory. The form of the BRST field breaks the symmetry in a tractable way such that the symmetry continues to be useful in practical perturbative computations as an expansion around some background. The new Moyal basis is called the $\\sigma $-basis, where $\\sigma$ is the worldsheet parameter of an open string. A vital part of the new star product is a natural and crucially needed mid-point regulator in this continuous basis, so that all computations are finite. The regulator is removed after renormalization and then the theory is finite only in the critical dimension. Boundary conditions for D-branes at the endpoints of the string are naturally introduced and made part of the theory as simple rules in algebraic computations. A byproduct of our approach is an astonishing suggestion of the formalism: the roots of ordinary quantum mechanics may originate in the rules of non-commutative interactions in string theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bars","given":"Itzhak"},{"family":"Rychkov","given":"Dmitry"}],"citation-key":"bars2014","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1407.4699","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,20]]},"number":"arXiv:1407.4699","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Background Independent String Field Theory","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4699"},

The book emphasises the interactions between topics, and each topic is constantly illustrated by using it to describe and discuss the others.

Here we propose a truly quantum analogue of classical neurons, which form quantum feedforward neural networks capable of universal quantum computation. We describe the efficient training of these networks using the fidelity as a cost function, providing both classical and efficient quantum implementations. Our method allows for fast optimisation with reduced memory requirements: the number of qudits required scales with only the width, allowing deep-network optimisation.

  {"id":"beer2022","abstract":"This PhD thesis combines two of the most exciting research areas of the last decades: quantum computing and machine learning. We introduce dissipative quantum neural networks (DQNNs), which are designed for fully quantum learning tasks, are capable of universal quantum computation and have low memory requirements while training. These networks are optimised with training data pairs in form of input and desired output states and therefore can be used for characterising unknown or untrusted quantum devices. We not only demonstrate the generalisation behaviour of DQNNs using classical simulations, but also implement them successfully on actual quantum computers. To understand the ultimate limits for such quantum machine learning methods, we discuss the quantum no free lunch theorem, which describes a bound on the probability that a quantum device, which can be modelled as a unitary process and is optimised with quantum examples, gives an incorrect output for a random input. Moreover we expand the area of applications of DQNNs in two directions. In the first case, we include additional information beyond just the training data pairs: since quantum devices are always structured, the resulting data is always structured as well. We modify the DQNN's training algorithm such that knowledge about the graph-structure of the training data pairs is included in the training process and show that this can lead to better generalisation behaviour. Both the original DQNN and the DQNN including graph structure are trained with data pairs in order to characterise an underlying relation. However, in the second extension of the algorithm we aim to learn characteristics of a set of quantum states in order to extend it to quantum states which have similar properties. Therefore we build a generative adversarial model where two DQNNs, called the generator and discriminator, are trained in a competitive way.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Beer","given":"Kerstin"}],"citation-key":"beer2022","DOI":"10.15488/11896","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum neural networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08154"},

  {"id":"bernQuantumFieldTheory2023","abstract":"A previous paper (arxiv:2203.06202) identified a puzzle stemming from the amplitudes-based approach to spinning bodies in general relativity: additional Wilson coefficients appear compared to current worldline approaches to conservative dynamics of generic astrophysical objects, including neutron stars. In this paper we clarify the nature of analogous Wilson coefficients in the simpler theory of electrodynamics. We analyze the original field-theory construction, identifying definite-spin states some of which have negative norms, and relating the additional Wilson coefficients in the classical theory to transitions between different quantum spin states. We produce a new version of the theory which also has additional Wilson coefficients, but no negative-norm states. We match, through $\\mathcal O(\\alpha^2)$ and $\\mathcal O(S^2)$, the Compton amplitudes of these field theories with those of a modified worldline theory with extra degrees of freedom introduced by releasing the spin supplementary condition. We build an effective two-body Hamiltonian that matches the impulse and spin kick of the modified field theory and of the worldline theory, displaying additional Wilson coefficients compared to standard worldline approaches. The results are then compactly expressed in terms of an eikonal formula. Our key conclusion is that, contrary to standard approaches, while the magnitude of the spin tensor is still conserved, the magnitude of the spin vector can change under conserved Hamiltonian dynamics and this change is governed by the additional Wilson coefficients. For specific values of Wilson coefficients the results are equivalent to those from a definite spin obeying the spin supplementary condition, but for generic values they are physically inequivalent. These results warrant detailed studies of the corresponding issues in general relativity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bern","given":"Zvi"},{"family":"Kosmopoulos","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Luna","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Roiban","given":"Radu"},{"family":"Scheopner","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Teng","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Vines","given":"Justin"}],"citation-key":"bernQuantumFieldTheory2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,27]]},"number":"arXiv:2308.14176","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum Field Theory, Worldline Theory, and Spin Magnitude Change in Orbital Evolution","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14176"},

Previous algorithms had optimal or near-optimal scaling in some parameters at the cost of poor scaling in others. Hamiltonian simulation via a quantum walk has optimal dependence on the sparsity at the expense of poor scaling in the allowed error. In contrast, an approach based on fractional-query simulation provides optimal scaling in the error at the expense of poor scaling in the sparsity. Here we combine the two approaches, achieving the best features of both. By implementing a linear combination of quantum walk steps with coefficients given by Bessel functions, our algorithm's complexity (as measured by the number of queries and 2-qubit gates) is logarithmic in the inverse error, and nearly linear in the product $\\tau$ of the evolution time, the sparsity, and the magnitude of the largest entry of the Hamiltonian.

  {"id":"bharti2022","abstract":"Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are convex optimization programs with vast applications in control theory, quantum information, combinatorial optimization and operational research. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms aim to make an efficient use of the current generation of quantum hardware. However, optimizing variational quantum algorithms is a challenge as it is an NP-hard problem that in general requires an exponential time to solve and can contain many far from optimal local minima. Here, we present a current term NISQ algorithm for solving SDPs. The classical optimization program of our NISQ solver is another SDP over a lower dimensional ansatz space. We harness the SDP based formulation of the Hamiltonian ground state problem to design a NISQ eigensolver. Unlike variational quantum eigensolvers, the classical optimization program of our eigensolver is convex, can be solved in polynomial time with the number of ansatz parameters and every local minimum is a global minimum. We find numeric evidence that NISQ SDP can improve the estimation of ground state energies in a scalable manner. Further, we efficiently solve constrained problems to calculate the excited states of Hamiltonians, find the lowest energy of symmetry constrained Hamiltonians and determine the optimal measurements for quantum state discrimination.

This approach lead to a unification of several ideas, as well as several results and methods that have not previously appeared in either side of the literature. Our approach enabled the development of a tensor network framework allowing a solution to the quantum decomposition problem which has several appealing features. Specifically, given an n-body quantum state S, we present a new and general method to factor S into a tensor network of clearly defined building blocks. We use the solution to expose a previously unknown and large class of quantum states which we prove can be sampled efficiently and exactly. This general framework of categorical tensor network states, where a combination of generic and algebraically defined tensors appear, enhances the theory of tensor network states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Biamonte","given":"Jacob D."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Stephen R."},{"family":"Jaksch","given":"Dieter"}],"citation-key":"biamonte2011","container-title":"AIP Advances","container-title-short":"AIP Advances","DOI":"10.1063/1.3672009","ISSN":"2158-3226","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12]]},"page":"042172","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Categorical Tensor Network States","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0531","volume":"1"},

Beginning with the key definitions, the graphical tensor network language is presented through examples. We then provide an introduction to matrix product states.

However, the omnipresent phenomenon of barren plateaus - parameter regions with vanishing gradients - sets a persistent hurdle that drastically diminishes its success in practice. In this work, we introduce an approach - based on non-unitary operations - that favours jumps out of a barren plateau into a fertile valley. These operations are constructed from conic extensions of parameterised unitary quantum circuits, relying on mid-circuit measurements and a small ancilla system. We further reduce the problem of finding optimal jump directions to a low-dimensional generalised eigenvalue problem. As a proof of concept we incorporate jumps within state-of-the-art implementations of the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA). We demonstrate the extensions' effectiveness on QAOA through extensive simulations, showcasing robustness against barren plateaus and highly improved sampling probabilities of optimal solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Binkowski","given":"Lennart"},{"family":"Koßmann","given":"Gereon"},{"family":"Osborne","given":"Tobias J."},{"family":"Schwonnek","given":"René"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Timo"}],"citation-key":"binkowski2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2310.04255","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2310.04255","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"From barren plateaus through fertile valleys: Conic extensions of parameterised quantum circuits","title-short":"From barren plateaus through fertile valleys","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04255"},

  {"id":"bisschop2017","abstract":"Stochastic effects in lithography are usually quantified through local CD variability metrics, such as line-width roughness or local CD uniformity (LCDU), and these quantities have been measured and studied intensively, both in EUV and optical lithography. Next to the CD-variability, stochastic effects can also give rise to local, random printing failures, such as missing contacts or microbridges in spaces. When these occur, there often is no (reliable) CD to be measured locally, and then such failures cannot be quantified with the usual CD-measuring techniques. We have developed algorithms to detect such stochastic printing failures in regular line/space (L/S) or contact- or dot-arrays from SEM images, leading to a stochastic failure metric that we call NOK (not OK), which we consider a complementary metric to the CD-variability metrics. This paper will show how both types of metrics can be used to experimentally quantify dependencies of stochastic effects to, e.g., CD, pitch, resist, exposure dose, etc. As it is also important to be able to predict upfront (in the OPC verification stage of a production-mask tape-out) whether certain structures in the layout are likely to have a high sensitivity to stochastic effects, we look into the feasibility of constructing simple predictors, for both stochastic CD-variability and printing failure, that can be calibrated for the process and exposure conditions used and integrated into the standard OPC verification flow. Finally, we briefly discuss the options to reduce stochastic variability and failure, considering the entire patterning ecosystem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bisschop","given":"Peter De"}],"citation-key":"bisschop2017","container-title":"Journal of Micro/Nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS","container-title-short":"JM3.1","DOI":"10.1117/1.JMM.16.4.041013","ISSN":"1932-5150, 1932-5134","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"page":"041013","publisher":"SPIE","source":"www.spiedigitallibrary.org","title":"Stochastic effects in EUV lithography: random, local CD variability, and printing failures","title-short":"Stochastic effects in EUV lithography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-micro-nanolithography-mems-and-moems/volume-16/issue-4/041013/Stochastic-effects-in-EUV-lithography--random-local-CD-variability/10.1117/1.JMM.16.4.041013.full","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"bluvstein2024","abstract":"Suppressing errors is the central challenge for useful quantum computing, requiring quantum error correction for large-scale processing. However, the overhead in the realization of error-corrected ``logical'' qubits, where information is encoded across many physical qubits for redundancy, poses significant challenges to large-scale logical quantum computing. Here we report the realization of a programmable quantum processor based on encoded logical qubits operating with up to 280 physical qubits. Utilizing logical-level control and a zoned architecture in reconfigurable neutral atom arrays, our system combines high two-qubit gate fidelities, arbitrary connectivity, as well as fully programmable single-qubit rotations and mid-circuit readout. Operating this logical processor with various types of encodings, we demonstrate improvement of a two-qubit logic gate by scaling surface code distance from d=3 to d=7, preparation of color code qubits with break-even fidelities, fault-tolerant creation of logical GHZ states and feedforward entanglement teleportation, as well as operation of 40 color code qubits. Finally, using three-dimensional [[8,3,2]] code blocks, we realize computationally complex sampling circuits with up to 48 logical qubits entangled with hypercube connectivity with 228 logical two-qubit gates and 48 logical CCZ gates. We find that this logical encoding substantially improves algorithmic performance with error detection, outperforming physical qubit fidelities at both cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum simulations of fast scrambling. These results herald the advent of early error-corrected quantum computation and chart a path toward large-scale logical processors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bluvstein","given":"Dolev"},{"family":"Evered","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Geim","given":"Alexandra A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Sophie H."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Hengyun"},{"family":"Manovitz","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Ebadi","given":"Sepehr"},{"family":"Cain","given":"Madelyn"},{"family":"Kalinowski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Hangleiter","given":"Dominik"},{"family":"Ataides","given":"J.

  {"id":"bogolubov2012","abstract":"The majority of the \"memorable\" results of relativistic quantum theory were obtained within the framework of the local quantum field approach. The explanation of the basic principles of the local theory and its mathematical structure has left its mark on all modern activity in this area. Originally, the axiomatic approach arose from attempts to give a mathematical meaning to the quantum field theory of strong interactions (of Yukawa type). The fields in such a theory are realized by operators in Hilbert space with a positive Poincare-invariant scalar product. This \"classical\" part of the axiomatic approach attained its modern form as far back as the sixties. * It has retained its importance even to this day, in spite of the fact that nowadays the main prospects for the description of the electro-weak and strong interactions are in connection with the theory of gauge fields. In fact, from the point of view of the quark model, the theory of strong interactions of Wightman type was obtained by restricting attention to just the \"physical\" local operators (such as hadronic fields consisting of ''fundamental'' quark fields) acting in a Hilbert space of physical states. In principle, there are enough such \"physical\" fields for a description of hadronic physics, although this means that one must reject the traditional local Lagrangian formalism. (The connection is restored in the approximation of low-energy \"phe nomenological\" Lagrangians.","author":[{"family":"Bogolubov","given":"N.

  {"id":"bollobas1998","abstract":"The time has now come when graph theory should be part of the education of every serious student of mathematics and computer science, both for its own sake and to enhance the appreciation of mathematics as a whole. This book is an in-depth account of graph theory, written with such a student in mind; it reflects the current state of the subject and emphasizes connections with other branches of pure mathematics. The volume grew out of the author's earlier book, Graph Theory -- An Introductory Course, but its length is well over twice that of its predecessor, allowing it to reveal many exciting new developments in the subject. Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, the book contains extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest. In addition to a modern treatment of the classical areas of graph theory such as coloring, matching, extremal theory, and algebraic graph theory, the book presents a detailed account of newer topics, including Szemer\\'edi's Regularity Lemma and its use, Shelah's extension of the Hales-Jewett Theorem, the precise nature of the phase transition in a random graph process, the connection between electrical networks and random walks on graphs, and the Tutte polynomial and its cousins in knot theory. In no other branch of mathematics is it as vital to tackle and solve challenging exercises in order to master the subject. To this end, the book contains an unusually large number of well thought-out exercises: over 600 in total. Although some are straightforward, most of them are substantial, and others will stretch even the most able reader.","author":[{"family":"Bollobas","given":"Bela"}],"citation-key":"bollobas1998","ISBN":"978-0-387-98488-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"422","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Modern Graph Theory","type":"book"},

In the setting of stabiliser quantum mechanics, this scalable notation gives an extremely concise description of graph states, which can be composed via ``phased spider fusion.''

Some acquaintance with manifolds, simplicial complexes, singular homology and cohomology, and homotopy groups is helpful, but not really necessary.

  {"id":"bravyi2013","abstract":"Quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers known as LDPC codes have been actively studied recently due to their simple syndrome readout circuits and potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, all families of quantum LDPC codes known to this date suffer from a poor distance scaling limited by the square-root of the code length. This is in a sharp contrast with the classical case where good families of LDPC codes are known that combine constant encoding rate and linear distance. Here we propose the first family of good quantum codes with low-weight stabilizers. The new codes have a constant encoding rate, linear distance, and stabilizers acting on at most $\\sqrt{n}$ qubits, where $n$ is the code length. For comparison, all previously known families of good quantum codes have stabilizers of linear weight. Our proof combines two techniques: randomized constructions of good quantum codes and the homological product operation from algebraic topology. We conjecture that similar methods can produce good stabilizer codes with stabilizer weight $n^a$ for any $a>0$. Finally, we apply the homological product to construct new small codes with low-weight stabilizers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bravyi","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Hastings","given":"Matthew B."}],"citation-key":"bravyi2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,4]]},"number":"arXiv:1311.0885","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Homological Product Codes","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0885"},

Thus a more descriptive title for this book might have been Algebraic Topology from the Point of View of Sheaf Theory. Several innovations will be found in this book. Notably, the con cept of the \"tautness\" of a subspace (an adaptation of an analogous no tion of Spanier to sheaf-theoretic cohomology) is introduced and exploited throughout the book. The fact that sheaf-theoretic cohomology satisfies 1 the homotopy property is proved for general topological spaces. Also, relative cohomology is introduced into sheaf theory. Concerning relative cohomology, it should be noted that sheaf-theoretic cohomology is usually considered as a \"single space\" theory.","author":[{"family":"Bredon","given":"Glen E."}],"citation-key":"bredon1997","ISBN":"978-0-387-94905-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",1,24]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"523","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Sheaf Theory","type":"book"},

KEYSER This time of writing is the hundredth anniversary of the publication (1892) of Poincare's first note on topology, which arguably marks the beginning of the subject of algebraic, or \"combinatorial,\" topology. There was earlier scattered work by Euler, Listing (who coined the word \"topology\"), Mobius and his band, Riemann, Klein, and Betti. Indeed, even as early as 1679, Leibniz indicated the desirability of creating a geometry of the topological type. The establishment of topology (or \"analysis situs\" as it was often called at the time) as a coherent theory, however, belongs to Poincare. Curiously, the beginning of general topology, also called \"point set topology,\" dates fourteen years later when Frechet published the first abstract treatment of the subject in 1906. Since the beginning of time, or at least the era of Archimedes, smooth manifolds (curves, surfaces, mechanical configurations, the universe) have been a central focus in mathematics. They have always been at the core of interest in topology. After the seminal work of Milnor, Smale, and many others, in the last half of this century, the topological aspects of smooth manifolds, as distinct from the differential geometric aspects, became a subject in its own right.","author":[{"family":"Bredon","given":"Glen E."}],"citation-key":"bredon2013","ISBN":"978-1-4757-6848-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,9]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"571","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Topology and Geometry","type":"book"},

In the first part we will consider closed surfaces with constant negative curvature. We show how such surfaces can be constructed and enumerate all quantum codes derived from them which have less than 10.000 physical qubits. For codes that are extremal in a certain sense we perform numerical simulations to determine the value of their threshold. Furthermore, we give evidence that these codes can be used for more overhead efficient storage as compared to the surface code by orders of magnitude. We also show how to read and write the encoded qubits while keeping their connectivity low. In the second part we consider codes in which qubits are layed-out according to a four- dimensional geometry. Such codes allow for much simpler decoding schemes compared to codes which are two-dimensional. In particular, measurements do not necessarily have to be repeated to obtain reliable information about the error and the classical hardware performing the error correction is greatly simplified. We perform numerical simulations to analyze the performance of these codes using decoders based on local updates.

To provide a self-contained presentation the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction into the foundations of quantummechanics with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes and dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and in the theory of quantum Brownian motion are applied to thestudy of many examples. Special attention is paid to the theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process and to the experimental observation of decohering Schrodinger cat states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics, such as Levy statistics in the lasercooling of atoms, and the damped Jaynes-Cummings model. The basic features of the non-Markovian quantum behaviour of open systems are examined on the basis of projection operator techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and discusses several examplesfrom a unified perspective, e.g. non-local measurements and quantum teleportation. Influence functional and super-operator techniques are employed to study the density matrix theory in quantum electrodynamics and applications to the destruction of quantum coherence are presented. The text addresses graduate students and lecturers in physics and applied mathematics, as well as researchers with interests in fundamental questions in quantum mechanics and its applications. Many analytical methods and computer simulation techniques are developed and illustrated with the help ofnumerous specific examples.

However, it would seem equally fair to state that, most likely, strings are here to stay and will playa profound and central role in our conception of the universe. There is therefore a pressing need to provide both practicing physicists and advanced students with ways to master quickly, but soundly, the basic principles of the theory.

  {"id":"bronstein2021","abstract":"The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Bronstein","given":"Michael M."},{"family":"Bruna","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Taco"},{"family":"Veličković","given":"Petar"}],"citation-key":"bronstein2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2104.13478","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,2]]},"number":"arXiv:2104.13478","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges","title-short":"Geometric Deep Learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478"},

Quantum error correction has made it possible to actively correct errors that affect a quantum memory.

Indeed, passive protection is the basis of robust and scalable classical technology, physically realized in the form of the transistor and the ferromagnetic hard disk. The discovery of an analogous quantum system is a challenging open problem, plagued with a variety of no-go theorems. Several approaches have been devised to overcome these theorems by taking advantage of their loopholes.

  {"id":"brunettiGenerallyCovariantLocality2003","abstract":"A new approach to the model-independent description of quantum field theories will be introduced in the present work. The main feature of this new approach is to incorporate in a local sense the principle of general covariance of general relativity, thus giving rise to the concept of a \"locally covariant quantum field theory\". Such locally covariant quantum field theories will be described mathematically in terms of covariant functors between the categories, on one side, of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with isometric embeddings as morphisms and, on the other side, of *-algebras with unital injective *-endomorphisms as morphisms. Moreover, locally covariant quantum fields can be described in this framework as natural transformations between certain functors. The usual Haag-Kastler framework of nets of operator-algebras over a fixed spacetime background-manifold, together with covariant automorphic actions of the isometry-group of the background spacetime, can be re-gained from this new approach as a special case. Examples of this new approach are also outlined. In case that a locally covariant quantum field theory obeys the time-slice axiom, one can naturally associate to it certain automorphic actions, called ``relative Cauchy-evolutions'', which describe the dynamical reaction of the quantum field theory to a local change of spacetime background metrics. The functional derivative of a relative Cauchy-evolution with respect to the spacetime metric is found to be a divergence-free quantity which has, as will be demonstrated in an example, the significance of an energy-momentum tensor for the locally covariant quantum field theory. Furthermore, we discuss the functorial properties of state spaces of locally covariant quantum field theories that entail the validity of the principle of local definiteness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Brunetti","given":"Romeo"},{"family":"Fredenhagen","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Verch","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"brunettiGenerallyCovariantLocality2003","container-title":"Communications in Mathematical Physics","container-title-short":"Commun.

  {"id":"bullock2004","abstract":"The two-qubit canonical decomposition SU(4) = [SU(2) \\otimes SU(2)] Delta [SU(2) \\otimes SU(2)] writes any two-qubit quantum computation as a composition of a local unitary, a relative phasing of Bell states, and a second local unitary. Using Lie theory, we generalize this to an n-qubit decomposition, the concurrence canonical decomposition (C.C.D.) SU(2^n)=KAK. The group K fixes a bilinear form related to the concurrence, and in particular any computation in K preserves the tangle |<phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1)...(-i sigma^y_n)|phi>|^2 for n even. Thus, the C.C.D. shows that any n-qubit quantum computation is a composition of a computation preserving this n-tangle, a computation in A which applies relative phases to a set of GHZ states, and a second computation which preserves it. As an application, we study the extent to which a large, random unitary may change concurrence.

  {"id":"bullock2005","abstract":"For n an even number of qubits and v a unitary evolution, a matrix decomposition v=k1 a k2 of the unitary group is explicitly computable and allows for study of the dynamics of the concurrence entanglement monotone. The side factors k1 and k2 of this Concurrence Canonical Decomposition (CCD) are concurrence symmetries, so the dynamics reduce to consideration of the a factor. In this work, we provide an explicit numerical algorithm computing v=k1 a k2 for n odd. Further, in the odd case we lift the monotone to a two-argument function, allowing for a theory of concurrence dynamics in odd qubits. The generalization may also be studied using the CCD, leading again to maximal concurrence capacity for most unitaries. The key technique is to consider the spin-flip as a time reversal symmetry operator in Wigner's axiomatization; the original CCD derivation may be restated entirely in terms of this time reversal. En route, we observe a Kramers' nondegeneracy: the existence of a nondegenerate eigenstate of any time reversal symmetric n-qubit Hamiltonian demands (i) n even and (ii) maximal concurrence of said eigenstate. We provide examples of how to apply this work to study the kinematics and dynamics of entanglement in spin chain Hamiltonians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bullock","given":"Stephen S."},{"family":"Brennen","given":"Gavin K."},{"family":"O'Leary","given":"Dianne P."}],"citation-key":"bullock2005","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","container-title-short":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.1900293","ISSN":"0022-2488, 1089-7658","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6]]},"page":"062104","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Time Reversal and n-qubit Canonical Decompositions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402051","volume":"46"},

  {"id":"burkard2021","abstract":"The spin degree of freedom of an electron or a nucleus is one of the most basic properties of nature and functions as an excellent qubit, as it provides a natural two-level system that is insensitive to electric fields, leading to long quantum coherence times. We review the physics of semiconductor spin qubits, focusing not only on the early achievements of spin initialization, control, and readout in GaAs quantum dots, but also on recent advances in Si and Ge spin qubits, including improved charge control and readout, coupling to other quantum degrees of freedom, and scaling to larger system sizes. We begin by introducing the four major types of spin qubits: single spin qubits, donor spin qubits, singlet-triplet spin qubits, and exchange-only spin qubits. We then review the mesoscopic physics of quantum dots, including single-electron charging, valleys, and spin-orbit coupling. We next give a comprehensive overview of the physics of exchange interactions, a crucial resource for single- and two-qubit control in spin qubits. The bulk of this review is centered on the presentation of results from each major spin qubit type, the present limits of fidelity, and a brief overview of alternative spin qubit platforms. We then give a physical description of the impact of noise on semiconductor spin qubits, aided in large part by an introduction to the filter function formalism. Lastly, we review recent efforts to hybridize spin qubits with superconducting systems, including charge-photon coupling, spin-photon coupling, and long-range cavity-mediated spin-spin interactions. Cavity-based readout approaches are also discussed. This review is intended to give an appreciation for the future prospects of semiconductor spin qubits, while highlighting the key advances in mesoscopic physics over the past two decades that underlie the operation of modern quantum-dot and donor spin qubits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Burkard","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Ladd","given":"Thaddeus D."},{"family":"Nichol","given":"John M."},{"family":"Pan","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Petta","given":"Jason R."}],"citation-key":"burkard2021","container-title":"arXiv:2112.08863 [cond-mat, physics:physics, physics:quant-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Semiconductor Spin Qubits","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08863"},

  {"id":"cahill1969","abstract":"The problem of expanding a density operator ρ in forms that simplify the evaluation of important classes of quantum-mechanical expectation values is studied. The weight function P(α) of the P representation, the Wigner distribution W(α), and the function ⟨α|ρ|α⟩, where |α⟩ is a coherent state, are discussed from a unified point of view. Each of these quasiprobability distributions is examined as the expectation value of a Hermitian operator, as the weight function of an integral representation for the density operator and as the function associated with the density operator by one of the operator-function correspondences defined in the preceding paper. The weight function P(α) of the P representation is shown to be the expectation value of a Hermitian operator all of whose eigenvalues are infinite. The existence of the function P(α) as an infinitely differentiable function is found to be equivalent to the existence of a well-defined antinormally ordered series expansion for the density operator in powers of the annihilation and creation operators a and a†. The Wigner distribution W(α) is shown to be a continuous, uniformly bounded, square-integrable weight function for an integral expansion of the density operator and to be the function associated with the symmetrically ordered power-series expansion of the density operator. The function ⟨α|ρ|α⟩, which is infinitely differentiable, corresponds to the normally ordered form of the density operator. Its use as a weight function in an integral expansion of the density operator is shown to involve singularities that are closely related to those which occur in the P representation. A parametrized integral expansion of the density operator is introduced in which the weight function W(α,s) may be identified with the weight function P(α) of the P representation, with the Wigner distribution W(α), and with the function ⟨α|ρ|α⟩ when the order parameter s assumes the values s=+1, 0, −1, respectively. The function W(α,s) is shown to be the expectation value of the ordered operator analog of the δ function defined in the preceding paper. This operator is in the trace class for Res<0, has bounded eigenvalues for Res=0, and has infinite eigenvalues for s=1. Marked changes in the properties of the quasiprobability distribution W(α,s) are exhibited as the order parameter s is varied continuously from s=−1, corresponding to the function ⟨α|ρ|α⟩, to s=+1, corresponding to the function P(α). Methods for constructing these functions and for using them to compute expectation values are presented and illustrated with several examples. One of these examples leads to a physical characterization of the density operators for which the P representation is appropriate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cahill","given":"K.

  {"id":"cahill1969a","abstract":"The expansion of operators as ordered power series in the annihilation and creation operators a and a† is examined. It is found that normally ordered power series exist and converge quite generally, but that for the case of antinormal ordering the required c-number coefficients are infinite for important classes of operators. A parametric ordering convention is introduced according to which normal, symmetric, and antinormal ordering correspond to the values s=+1,0,−1, respectively, of an order parameter s. In terms of this convention it is shown that for bounded operators the coefficients are finite when s>0, and the series are convergent when s>12. For each value of the order parameter s, a correspondence between operators and c-number functions is defined. Each correspondence is one-to-one and has the property that the function f(α) associated with a given operator F is the one which results when the operators a and a† occurring in the ordered power series for F are replaced by their complex eigenvalues α and α∗. The correspondence which is realized for symmetric ordering is the Weyl correspondence. The operators associated by each correspondence with the set of δ functions on the complex plane are discussed in detail. They are shown to furnish, for each ordering, an operator basis for an integral representation for arbitrary operators. The weight functions in these representations are simply the functions that correspond to the operators being expanded. The representation distinguished by antinormal ordering expresses operators as integrals of projection operators upon the coherent states, which is the form taken by the P representation for the particular case of the density operator. The properties of the full set of representations are discussed and are shown to vary markedly with the order parameter s.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cahill","given":"K.

  {"id":"cao2019","abstract":"Practical challenges in simulating quantum systems on classical computers have been widely recognized in the quantum physics and quantum chemistry communities over the past century. Although many approximation methods have been introduced, the complexity of quantum mechanics remains hard to appease. The advent of quantum computation brings new pathways to navigate this challenging and complex landscape. By manipulating quantum states of matter and taking advantage of their unique features such as superposition and entanglement, quantum computers promise to efficiently deliver accurate results for many important problems in quantum chemistry, such as the electronic structure of molecules. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made in developing algorithms and physical hardware for quantum computing, heralding a revolution in simulation of quantum systems. This Review provides an overview of the algorithms and results that are relevant for quantum chemistry. The intended audience is both quantum chemists who seek to learn more about quantum computing and quantum computing researchers who would like to explore applications in quantum chemistry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Yudong"},{"family":"Romero","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Jonathan P."},{"family":"Degroote","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Peter D."},{"family":"Kieferová","given":"Mária"},{"family":"Kivlichan","given":"Ian D."},{"family":"Menke","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Peropadre","given":"Borja"},{"family":"Sawaya","given":"Nicolas P.

  {"id":"caves2002","abstract":"In the Bayesian approach to probability theory, probability quantifies a degree of belief for a single trial, without any a priori connection to limiting frequencies. In this paper we show that, despite being prescribed by a fundamental law, probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood within the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical and quantum probabilities lies not in their definition, but in the nature of the information they encode. In the classical world, maximal information about a physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world, maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this distinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment, and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Caves","given":"Carlton M."},{"family":"Fuchs","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Schack","given":"Ruediger"}],"citation-key":"caves2002","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs.

Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining C with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of V(θ) is $${\\mathcal{O}}(\\mathrm{log}\\,n)$$.

The spectral approach to geometry is then explained to encompass two natural ingredients: the line element and the algebra. The relation between these two is dictated by so-called higher Heisenberg relations, from which both spin geometry and non-abelian gauge theory emerges. Our exposition indicates some of the applications in physics, including Pati--Salam unification beyond the Standard Model, the criticality of dimension 4, second quantization and entropy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chamseddine","given":"Ali H."},{"family":"Connes","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Suijlekom","given":"Walter D.","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"chamseddine2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2207.10901","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2207.10901","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Noncommutativity and Physics: A non-technical review","title-short":"Noncommutativity and Physics","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10901"},

To this end, we consider a general linear non-autonomous dynamical system on the special linear group .

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations.

  {"id":"chen2022","abstract":"The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a key component of many important quantum algorithms, most famously as being the essential ingredient in Shor's algorithm for factoring products of primes. Given its remarkable capability, one would think it can introduce large entanglement to qubit systems and would be difficult to simulate classically. While early results showed QFT indeed has maximal operator entanglement, we show that this is entirely due to the bit reversal in the QFT. The core part of the QFT has Schmidt coefficients decaying exponentially quickly, and thus it can only generate a constant amount of entanglement regardless of the number of qubits. In addition, we show the entangling power of the QFT is the same as the time evolution of a Hamiltonian with exponentially decaying interactions, and thus a variant of the area law for dynamics can be used to understand the low entanglement intuitively. Using the low entanglement property of the QFT, we show that classical simulations of the QFT on a matrix product state with low bond dimension only take time linear in the number of qubits, providing a potential speedup over the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) on many classes of functions. We demonstrate this speedup in test calculations on some simple functions. For data vectors of length $10^6$ to $10^8$, the speedup can be a few orders of magnitude.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Jielun"},{"family":"Stoudenmire","given":"E.

  {"id":"chen2022a","abstract":"With the advent of quantum processors exceeding $100$ qubits and the high engineering complexities involved, there is a need for holistically benchmarking the processor to have quality assurance. Linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) has been used extensively for systems with $50$ or more qubits but is fundamentally limited in scale due to the exponentially large computational resources required for classical simulation. In this work we propose conducting linear XEB with Clifford circuits, a scheme we call Clifford XEB. Since Clifford circuits can be simulated in polynomial time, Clifford XEB can be scaled to much larger systems. To validate this claim, we run numerical simulations for particular classes of Clifford circuits with noise and observe exponential decays. When noise levels are low, the decay rates are well-correlated with the noise of each cycle assuming a digital error model. We perform simulations of systems up to 1,225 qubits, where the classical processing task can be easily dealt with by a workstation. Furthermore, using the theoretical guarantees in Chen et al. (arXiv:2203.12703), we prove that Clifford XEB with our proposed Clifford circuits must yield exponential decays under a general error model for sufficiently low errors. Our theoretical results explain some of the phenomena observed in the simulations and shed light on the behavior of general linear XEB experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianxin"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Dawei"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cupjin"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Linghang"}],"citation-key":"chen2022a","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2206.08293","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"number":"arXiv:2206.08293","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Linear Cross Entropy Benchmarking with Clifford Circuits","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08293"},

  {"id":"cheung2016","abstract":"We reformulate the scattering amplitudes of 4D flat space gauge theory and gravity in the language of a 2D CFT on the celestial sphere. The resulting CFT structure exhibits an OPE constructed from 4D collinear singularities, as well as infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras encoding the asymptotic symmetries of 4D flat space. We derive these results by recasting 4D dynamics in terms of a convenient foliation of flat space into 3D Euclidean AdS and Lorentzian dS geometries. Tree-level scattering amplitudes take the form of Witten diagrams for a continuum of (A)dS modes, which are in turn equivalent to CFT correlators via the (A)dS/CFT dictionary. The Ward identities for the 2D conserved currents are dual to 4D soft theorems, while the bulk-boundary propagators of massless (A)dS modes are superpositions of the leading and subleading Weinberg soft factors of gauge theory and gravity. In general, the massless (A)dS modes are 3D Chern-Simons gauge fields describing the soft, single helicity sectors of 4D gauge theory and gravity. Consistent with the topological nature of Chern-Simons theory, Aharonov-Bohm effects record the \"tracks\" of hard particles in the soft radiation, leading to a simple characterization of gauge and gravitational memories. Soft particle exchanges between hard processes define the Kac-Moody level and Virasoro central charge, which are thereby related to the 4D gauge coupling and gravitational strength in units of an infrared cutoff. Finally, we discuss a toy model for black hole horizons via a restriction to the Rindler region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheung","given":"Clifford"},{"family":"Fuente","given":"Anton","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Sundrum","given":"Raman"}],"citation-key":"cheung2016","DOI":"10.1007/JHEP01(2017)112","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"language":"en","source":"arxiv.org","title":"4D Scattering Amplitudes and Asymptotic Symmetries from 2D CFT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00732v2"},

At each stage of the text, the reader is given an intuition based on standard mathematical practice, which is subsequently developed with clean formal mathematics. Alongside the practical examples, readers learn what can and can't be calculated; for example the correctness of a derivation proving a given sequent can be tested mechanically, but there is no general mechanical test for the existence of a derivation proving the given sequent. The undecidability results are proved rigorously in an optional final chapter, assuming Matiyasevich's theorem characterising the computably enumerable relations. Rigorous proofs of the adequacy and completeness proofs of the relevant logics are provided, with careful attention to the languages involved. Optional sections discuss the classification of mathematical structures by first-order theories; the required theory of cardinality is developed from scratch. Throughout the book there are notes on historical aspects of the material, and connections with linguistics and computer science, and the discussion of syntax and semantics is influenced by modern linguistic approaches.

  {"id":"chitambar2019","abstract":"Quantum resource theories (QRTs) offer a highly versatile and powerful framework for studying different phenomena in quantum physics. From quantum entanglement to quantum computation, resource theories can be used to quantify a desirable quantum effect, develop new protocols for its detection, and identify processes that optimize its use for a given application. Particularly, QRTs revolutionize the way we think about familiar properties of physical systems like entanglement, elevating them from just being interesting from a fundamental point of view to being useful in performing practical tasks. The basic methodology of a general QRT involves partitioning all quantum states into two groups, one consisting of free states and the other consisting of resource states. Accompanying the set of free states is a collection of free quantum operations arising from natural restrictions on physical systems, and that consists of all the physical processes allowed by the resource theory and which acts invariantly on the set of free states. The QRT then studies what information processing tasks become possible using the restricted operations. Despite the large degree of freedom in how one defines the free states and free operations, unexpected similarities emerge among different QRTs in terms of resource measures and resource convertibility. As a result, objects that appear quite distinct on the surface, such as entanglement and quantum reference frames, appear to have great similarity on a deeper structural level. In this article we review the general framework of a quantum resource theory, focusing on common structural features, operational tasks, and resource measures. To illustrate these concepts, an overview is provided on some of the more commonly studied QRTs in the literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Chitambar","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Gour","given":"Gilad"}],"citation-key":"chitambar2019","container-title":"Reviews of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Rev.

  {"id":"cho2015","abstract":"Effectus theory is a new branch of categorical logic that aims to capture the essentials of quantum logic, with probabilistic and Boolean logic as special cases. Predicates in effectus theory are not subobjects having a Heyting algebra structure, like in topos theory, but `characteristic' functions, forming effect algebras. Such effect algebras are algebraic models of quantitative logic, in which double negation holds. Effects in quantum theory and fuzzy predicates in probability theory form examples of effect algebras. This text is an account of the basics of effectus theory. It includes the fundamental duality between states and effects, with the associated Born rule for validity of an effect (predicate) in a particular state. A basic result says that effectuses can be described equivalently in both `total' and `partial' form. So-called `commutative' and `Boolean' effectuses are distinguished, for probabilistic and classical models. It is shown how these Boolean effectuses are essentially extensive categories. A large part of the theory is devoted to the logical notions of comprehension and quotient, which are described abstractly as right adjoint to truth, and as left adjoint to falisity, respectively. It is illustrated how comprehension and quotients are closely related to measurement.

A comparative computational results confirm the importance of dynamic tunneling in gradient descent techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Chowdhury","given":"P.R."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Y.P."},{"family":"Chansarkar","given":"R.A."}],"citation-key":"chowdhury2000","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"chowdhury2021","abstract":"We present a review of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model of compressible quantum many-body systems without quasiparticle excitations, and its connections to various theoretical studies of non-Fermi liquids in condensed matter physics. The review is placed in the context of numerous experimental observations on correlated electron materials. Strong correlations in metals are often associated with their proximity to a Mott transition to an insulator created by the local Coulomb repulsion between the electrons. We explore the phase diagrams of a number of models of such local electronic correlation, employing a dynamical mean field theory in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. Numerical analyses and analytical solutions, using renormalization group methods and expansions in large spin degeneracy, lead to critical regions which display SYK physics. The models studied include the single-band Hubbard model, the $t$-$J$ model and the two-band Kondo-Heisenberg model in the presence of random spin exchange interactions. We also examine non-Fermi liquids obtained by considering each SYK model with random four-fermion interactions to be a multi-orbital atom, with the SYK-atoms arranged in an infinite lattice. We connect to theories of sharp Fermi surfaces without any low-energy quasiparticles in the absence of spatial disorder, obtained by coupling a Fermi liquid to a gapless boson; a systematic large $N$ theory of such a critical Fermi surface, with SYK characteristics, is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of theories with random boson-fermion couplings. Finally, we present an overview of the links between the SYK model and quantum gravity and end with an outlook on open questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Chowdhury","given":"Debanjan"},{"family":"Georges","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Parcollet","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Sachdev","given":"Subir"}],"citation-key":"chowdhury2021","DOI":"10.1103/RevModPhys.94.035004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,10]]},"language":"en","source":"arxiv.org","title":"Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models and Beyond: A Window into Non-Fermi Liquids","title-short":"Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models and Beyond","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05037v5"},
  {"id":"christandl2023","abstract":"Tensor networks provide succinct representations of quantum many-body states and are an important computational tool for strongly correlated quantum systems. Their expressive and computational power is characterized by an underlying entanglement structure, on a lattice or more generally a (hyper)graph, with virtual entangled pairs or multipartite entangled states associated to (hyper)edges. Changing this underlying entanglement structure into another can lead to both theoretical and computational benefits. We study a natural resource theory which generalizes the notion of bond dimension to entanglement structures using multipartite entanglement. It is a direct extension of resource theories of tensors studied in the context of multipartite entanglement and algebraic complexity theory, allowing for the application of the sophisticated methods developed in these fields to tensor networks. The resource theory of tensor networks concerns both the local entanglement structure of a quantum many-body state and the (algebraic) complexity of tensor network contractions using this entanglement structure. We show that there are transformations between entanglement structures which go beyond edge-by-edge conversions, highlighting efficiency gains of our resource theory that mirror those obtained in the search for better matrix multiplication algorithms. We also provide obstructions to the existence of such transformations by extending a variety of methods originally developed in algebraic complexity theory for obtaining complexity lower bounds. The resource theory of tensor networks allows to compare different entanglement structures and should lead to more efficient tensor network representations and contraction algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Christandl","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Lysikov","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Steffan","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Werner","given":"Albert H."},{"family":"Witteveen","given":"Freek"}],"citation-key":"christandl2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2307.07394","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"number":"arXiv:2307.07394","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The resource theory of tensor networks","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07394"},

The Feynman-Kac-Schrooinger development (§6.4) and the material on re­ flected Brownian motions (§8.5) have been updated.

Stochastic integration has grown in both theoretical and applicable importance in the last decade, to the extent that this new tool is now sometimes employed without heed to its rigorous requirements.

We hope this modest introduction to the theory and application of this new field may serve as a text at the beginning graduate level, much as certain standard texts in analysis do for the deterministic counterpart.

These brought together mathematicians and physicists working in operational quantum logic and related areas, as well as a number of interested philosophers of science, for a rare opportunity to discuss recent developments in this field. After some discussion, it was decided that, rather than producing a volume of conference proceedings, we would try to organize the conferees to produce a set of comprehensive survey papers, which would not only report on recent developments in quantum logic, but also provide a tutorial overview of the subject suitable for an interested non-specialist audience. The resulting volume provides an overview of the concepts and methods used in current research in quantum logic, viewed both as a branch of mathemati cal physics and as an area of pure mathematics. The first half of the book is concerned with the algebraic side of the subject, and in particular the theory of orthomodular lattices and posets, effect algebras, etc. In the second half of the book, special attention is given to categorical methods and to connections with theoretical computer science. At the 1999 workshop, we were fortunate to hear three excellent lectures by David J. Foulis, represented here by two contributions. Dave's work, spanning 40 years, has helped to define, and continues to reshape, the field of quantum logic.","author":[{"family":"Coecke","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Moore","given":"David"},{"family":"Wilce","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"coecke2000a","ISBN":"978-0-7923-6258-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",3,31]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"346","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Current Research in Operational Quantum Logic: Algebras, Categories, Languages","title-short":"Current Research in Operational Quantum Logic","type":"book"},
  {"id":"coecke2010","abstract":"While multipartite quantum states constitute a (if not the) key resource for quantum computations and protocols, obtaining a high-level, structural understanding of entanglement involving arbitrarily many qubits is a long-standing open problem in quantum computer science. In this paper we expose the algebraic and graphical structure of the GHZ-state and the W-state, as well as a purely graphical distinction that characterises the behaviours of these states. In turn, this structure yields a compositional graphical model for expressing general multipartite states. We identify those states, named Frobenius states, which canonically induce an algebraic structure, namely the structure of a commutative Frobenius algebra (CFA). We show that all SLOCC-maximal tripartite qubit states are locally equivalent to Frobenius states. Those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the GHZ-state induce special commutative Frobenius algebras, while those that are SLOCC-equivalent to the W-state induce what we call anti-special commutative Frobenius algebras. From the SLOCC-classification of tripartite qubit states follows a representation theorem for two dimensional CFAs. Together, a GHZ and a W Frobenius state form the primitives of a graphical calculus. This calculus is expressive enough to generate and reason about arbitrary multipartite states, which are obtained by \"composing\" the GHZ- and W-states, giving rise to a rich graphical paradigm for general multipartite entanglement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Coecke","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Kissinger","given":"Aleks"}],"citation-key":"coecke2010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,17]]},"number":"arXiv:1002.2540","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The compositional structure of multipartite quantum entanglement","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2540"},

  {"id":"cohen2012","abstract":"Historically, nonclassical physics developed in three stages. First came a collection of ad hoc assumptions and then a cookbook of equations known as \"quantum mechanics\". The equations and their philosophical underpinnings were then collected into a model based on the mathematics of Hilbert space. From the Hilbert space model came the abstaction of \"quantum logics\". This book explores all three stages, but not in historical order. Instead, in an effort to illustrate how physics and abstract mathematics influence each other we hop back and forth between a purely mathematical development of Hilbert space, and a physically motivated definition of a logic, partially linking the two throughout, and then bringing them together at the deepest level in the last two chapters. This book should be accessible to undergraduate and beginning graduate students in both mathematics and physics. The only strict prerequisites are calculus and linear algebra, but the level of mathematical sophistication assumes at least one or two intermediate courses, for example in mathematical analysis or advanced calculus. No background in physics is assumed.","author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"David W."}],"citation-key":"cohen2012","ISBN":"978-1-4613-8841-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,6]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"159","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"An Introduction to Hilbert Space and Quantum Logic","type":"book"},

In this paper, we extend this correspondence between stabilizer circuits and tableaus to the mixed setting; by regarding stabilizer codes as affine coisotropic susbspaces (again only in odd prime qudit dimension/for qubit CSS codes).

However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches. We further demonstrate that QCNNs can be used to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given, unknown error model that substantially outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. The potential experimental realizations and generalizations of QCNNs are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cong","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Soonwon"},{"family":"Lukin","given":"Mikhail D."}],"citation-key":"cong2019","container-title":"Nature Physics","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"conradLatticesGatesCurves2024","abstract":"Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Conrad","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Burchards","given":"Ansgar G."},{"family":"Flammia","given":"Steven T."}],"citation-key":"conradLatticesGatesCurves2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2407.03270","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2407.03270","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone","title-short":"Lattices, Gates, and Curves","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270"},

  {"id":"cowtanSSIPAutomatedSurgery2024","abstract":"We present Safe Surgery by Identifying Pushouts (SSIP), an open-source lightweight Python package for automating surgery between qubit CSS codes. SSIP is flexible: it is capable of performing both external surgery, that is surgery between two codeblocks, and internal surgery, that is surgery within the same codeblock. Under the hood, it performs linear algebra over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ governed by universal constructions in the category of chain complexes. We demonstrate on quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, which are not topological codes in general, and are of interest for near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing. Such qLDPC codes include lift-connected surface codes, generalised bicycle codes and bivariate bicycle codes. We show that various logical measurements can be performed cheaply by surgery without sacrificing the high code distance. For example, half of the single-qubit logical measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the $[[ 144 ,12, 12 ]]$ gross code require only 30 total additional qubits each, assuming the upper bound on distance given by QDistRnd is tight. This is two orders of magnitude lower than the additional qubit count of 1380 initially predicted by Bravyi et al.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cowtan","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"cowtanSSIPAutomatedSurgery2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2407.09423","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,12]]},"number":"arXiv:2407.09423","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"SSIP: automated surgery with quantum LDPC codes","title-short":"SSIP","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09423"},

  {"id":"croom2012","abstract":"This text is intended as a one semester introduction to algebraic topology at the undergraduate and beginning graduate levels. Basically, it covers simplicial homology theory, the fundamental group, covering spaces, the higher homotopy groups and introductory singular homology theory. The text follows a broad historical outline and uses the proofs of the discoverers of the important theorems when this is consistent with the elementary level of the course. This method of presentation is intended to reduce the abstract nature of algebraic topology to a level that is palatable for the beginning student and to provide motivation and cohesion that are often lacking in abstact treatments. The text emphasizes the geometric approach to algebraic topology and attempts to show the importance of topological concepts by applying them to problems of geometry and analysis. The prerequisites for this course are calculus at the sophomore level, a one semester introduction to the theory of groups, a one semester introduc tion to point-set topology and some familiarity with vector spaces. Outlines of the prerequisite material can be found in the appendices at the end of the text. It is suggested that the reader not spend time initially working on the appendices, but rather that he read from the beginning of the text, referring to the appendices as his memory needs refreshing.

Like any ground state preparation algorithm, this algorithm necessarily has exponential run-time in general (otherwise BQP=QMA), even for gapped, frustration-free Hamiltonians (otherwise BQP is in NP). However, this dissipative quantum eigensolver has a number of interesting characteristics, which give advantages over previous ground state preparation algorithms. - The entire algorithm consists simply of iterating the same set of local measurements repeatedly. - The expected overlap with the ground state subspace increases monotonically with the length of time this process is allowed to run. - It converges to the ground state subspace unconditionally, without any assumptions on or prior information about the Hamiltonian. - The algorithm does not require any variational optimisation over parameters. - It is often able to find the ground state in low circuit depth in practice. - It has a simple implementation on certain types of quantum hardware, in particular photonic quantum computers. - The process is immune to errors in the initial state. - It is inherently error- and noise-resilient, i.e. to errors during execution of the algorithm and also to faulty implementation of the algorithm itself, without incurring any computational overhead: the overlap of the output with the ground state subspace degrades smoothly with the error rate, independent of the algorithm's run-time.

The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures.

The explosive development of theoretical computer science in recent years has, in particular, influenced the book's evolution: a fresh treatment of fixpoints testifies to this and Galois connections now feature prominently. An early presentation of concept analysis gives both a concrete foundation for the subsequent theory of complete lattices and a glimpse of a methodology for data analysis that is of commercial value in social science. Classroom experience has led to numerous pedagogical improvements and many new exercises have been added. As before, exposure to elementary abstract algebra and the notation of set theory are the only prerequisites, making the book suitable for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students. It will also be a valuable resource for anyone who meets ordered structures.","author":[{"family":"Davey","given":"B. A."},{"family":"Priestley","given":"H.

The basic lattice surgery operations, the merging and splitting of logical qubits, act non-unitarily on the logical states and are not easily captured by standard circuit notation. This raises the question of how best to design, verify, and optimise protocols that use lattice surgery, in particular in architectures with complex resource management issues. In this paper we demonstrate that the operations of the ZX calculus -- a form of quantum diagrammatic reasoning based on bialgebras -- match exactly the operations of lattice surgery. Red and green \"spider\" nodes match rough and smooth merges and splits, and follow the axioms of a dagger special associative Frobenius algebra. Some lattice surgery operations require non-trivial correction operations, which are captured natively in the use of the ZX calculus in the form of ensembles of diagrams. We give a first taste of the power of the calculus as a language for lattice surgery by considering two operations (T gates and producing a CNOT ) and show how ZX diagram re-write rules give lattice surgery procedures for these operations that are novel, efficient, and highly configurable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Beaudrap","given":"Niel","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Horsman","given":"Dominic"}],"citation-key":"debeaudrap2020","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2020-01-09-218","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,9]]},"language":"en","page":"218","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The ZX calculus is a language for surface code lattice surgery","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08670","volume":"4"},

In contrast to more standard gate based methods, pulse based methods aim to directly optimize the laser pulses interacting with the qubits, instead of using some parametrized gate based circuit. Using the mathematical formalism of optimal control, these laser pulses are optimized. This method has been used in quantum computing to optimize pulses for quantum gate implementations, but has only recently been proposed for full optimization in VQAs. Pulse based methods have several advantages over gate based methods such as faster state preparation, simpler implementation and more freedom in moving through the state space. Based on these ideas, we present the development of a novel adjoint based variational method. This method can be tailored towards and applied in neutral atom quantum computers. This method of pulse based variational quantum optimal control is able to approximate molecular ground states of simple molecules up to chemical accuracy and is able to compete with the gate based variational quantum eigensolver in terms of total number of quantum evaluations. The total evolution time $T$ and the form of the control Hamiltonian $H_c$ are important factors in the convergence behavior to the ground state energy, both having influence on the quantum speed limit and the controllability of the system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Keijzer","given":"Robert","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Tse","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Kokkelmans","given":"Servaas"}],"citation-key":"dekeijzer2023","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2023-01-26-908","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,26]]},"page":"908","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Pulse based Variational Quantum Optimal Control for hybrid quantum computing","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08908","volume":"7"},

It is argued that it is precisely such a theory of measurement that should provide a meaning to the axiomatically introduced concepts, especially to the concept of observable. Defining an observable as a class of measurement procedures yielding a certain prescribed result for the probability distribution of the set of values of some quantity (to be described by the set of eigenvalues of some Hermitian operator), this notion is extended to joint probability distributions of incompatible observables. It is shown that such an extension is possible on the basis of a theory of measurement, under the proviso that in simultaneously measuring such observables there is a disturbance of the measurement results of the one observable, caused by the presence of the measuring instrument of the other observable. This has as a consequence that the joint probability distribution cannot obey the marginal distribution laws usually imposed. This result is of great importance in exposing quantum mechanics as an axiomatized theory, since overlooking it seems to prohibit an axiomatic description of simultaneous measurement of incompatible observables by quantum mechanics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Muynck","given":"Willem M.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Janssen","given":"Peter A.

  {"id":"devuyst2024","abstract":"In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan \"PW=CLPW\". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"De Vuyst","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Eccles","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Hoehn","given":"Philipp A."},{"family":"Kirklin","given":"Josh"}],"citation-key":"devuyst2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.00114","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114"},

Nachrichten (1897), 71-90] should be regarded as the origin of random matrix theory in mathematics. Here Hurwitz introduced and developed the notion of an invariant measure for the matrix groups $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$. He also specified a calculus from which the explicit form of these measures could be computed in terms of an appropriate parametrisation - Hurwitz chose to use Euler angles. This enabled him to define and compute invariant group integrals over $SO(N)$ and $U(N)$. His main result can be interpreted probabilistically: the Euler angles of a uniformly distributed matrix are independent with beta distributions (and conversely). We use this interpretation to give some new probability results. How Hurwitz's ideas and methods show themselves in the subsequent work of Weyl, Dyson and others on foundational studies in random matrix theory is detailed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Diaconis","given":"Persi"},{"family":"Forrester","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"diaconis2016","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1512.09229","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,8]]},"number":"arXiv:1512.09229","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A.

In Kohn–Sham DFT simulations, the balance between accuracy and computational cost depends on the choice of exchange and correlation functional, which only exists in approximate form. Here, we propose a framework to create density functionals using supervised machine learning, termed NeuralXC. These machine-learned functionals are designed to lift the accuracy of baseline functionals towards that provided by more accurate methods while maintaining their efficiency. We show that the functionals learn a meaningful representation of the physical information contained in the training data, making them transferable across systems. A NeuralXC functional optimized for water outperforms other methods characterizing bond breaking and excels when comparing against experimental results. This work demonstrates that NeuralXC is a first step towards the design of a universal, highly accurate functional valid for both molecules and solids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Dick","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Fernandez-Serra","given":"Marivi"}],"citation-key":"dick2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-17265-7","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,14]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"3509","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Machine learning accurate exchange and correlation functionals of the electronic density","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17265-7","volume":"11"},

We solve the main shortcoming of our previous approach, which prevented the development of a fully covariant quantum field theory: the emergence of a non-Lorentz-invariant boundary of momentum space. To solve this issue, we propose to ``extend\" momentum space by introducing a class of new Fourier modes and we prove that this approach leads to a consistent definition of the Pauli-Jordan function, which turns out to be undeformed with respect to the commutative case.

The uncertainty principle and spatial symmetry emerge as critical tools for selecting initial conditions and understanding effective potentials.

Using a method as simple as possible, our goal is a brief introduction to the state of the art of hybrid dynamics, with a limited discussion of the implications for foundations and without discussion of further relevance in the measurement problem, quantum gravity, chemistry, numeric methods, etc. Hybrid dynamics is defined as a special case of composite quantum dynamics where the observables of one of the two subsystems are restricted to the commuting set of diagonal operators in a fixed basis. With this restriction, the derivation of hybrid dynamical equations is clear conceptually and simple technically. Jump and diffusive dynamics follow in the form of hybrid master equations. Their stochastic interpretation (called unravelings) is derived. We discuss gauge-type ambiguities, problems of uniqueness, and covariance of the diffusive master equation. Also conditions of minimum noise and of monitoring the quantum trajectory are derived. We conclude that the hybrid formalism is equivalent to the standard Markovian theory of time-continuous quantum measurement (monitoring) on the one hand and is a motivating alternative formalism on the other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Diósi","given":"Lajos"}],"citation-key":"diosi2023","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

For non-bijective canonical transformations the situation is more complex as the phase space acquires either a Riemann surface structure or requires the introduction of the concept of an ambiguity group. By discussing the non-bijective canonical transformation taking them from an oscillator of frequency kappa -1, where kappa is an integer, to one of unit frequency, they see how the kernel is generalised to include the indices associated with the irreducible representations of the ambiguity group, i.e. the ambiguity spins. They obtain the kernel explicitly and show that in the limit to 0 they recover the form that they expect in the Riemann surface picture of their phase space.

  {"id":"douglas2022","abstract":"We propose a generalized finiteness principle for physical theories, in terms of the concept of tameness in mathematical logic. A tame function or space can only have a finite amount of structure, in a precise sense which we explain. Tameness generalizes the notion of an analytic function to include certain non-analytic limits, and we show that this includes many limits which are known to arise in physics. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we give a general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame functions of the external momenta and the couplings. We then consider a variety of exact non-perturbative results and show that they are tame but only given constraints on the UV definition of the theory. This provides further evidence for the recent conjecture of the second author that all effective theories that can be coupled to quantum gravity are tame. We also discuss whether renormalization group flow is tame, and comment on the applicability of our results to effective theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Douglas","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Grimm","given":"Thomas W."},{"family":"Schlechter","given":"Lorenz"}],"citation-key":"douglas2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2210.10057","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,18]]},"number":"arXiv:2210.10057","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Tameness of Quantum Field Theory, Part I -- Amplitudes","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10057"},

However, it is by no means clear how to choose the measuring instrument of the composed observable $aA+bB$ ($a,b\\in \\mathbb{R}$) if such measuring instruments are given for the addends observables $A$ and $B$ when they are incompatible observables. A mathematical version of this dilemma is how to construct the spectral measure of $f(aA+bB)$ out of the spectral measures of $A$ and $B$. We present such a construction with a formula which is valid for generally unbounded selfadjoint operators $A$ and $B$, whose spectral measures may not commute, and a wide class of functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{C}$. We prove that, in the bounded case the Jordan product of $A$ and $B$ can be constructed with the same procedure out of the spectral measures of $A$ and $B$. The formula turns out to have an interesting operational interpretation and, in particular cases, a nice interplay with the theory of Feynman path integration and the Feynman-Kac formula.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Drago","given":"Nicolò"},{"family":"Mazzucchi","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Moretti","given":"Valter"}],"citation-key":"drago2020","container-title":"Letters in Mathematical Physics","container-title-short":"Lett Math Phys","DOI":"10.1007/s11005-020-01332-7","ISSN":"0377-9017, 1573-0530","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"page":"3197-3242","source":"arXiv.org","title":"An operational construction of the sum of two non-commuting observables in quantum theory and related constructions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10974","volume":"110"},

Integrable systems lie on the other extreme. They possess regular, stable, and well behaved solutions known as solitons and instantons. These solutions play important roles in pure and applied mathematics as well as in theoretical physics where they describe configurations topologically different from vacuum. While integrable equations in lower space-time dimensions can be solved using the inverse scattering transform, the higher-dimensional examples of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills and Einstein equations require twistor theory. Both techniques rely on an ability to represent nonlinear equations as compatibility conditions for overdetermined systems of linear differential equations. The book provides a self-contained and accessible introduction to the subject. It starts with an introduction to integrability of ordinary and partial differential equations.

While little is known about extracting circuits from arbitrary ZX-diagrams, we show that the underlying graph of our simplified ZX-diagram always has a graph-theoretic property called generalised flow, which in turn yields a deterministic circuit extraction procedure. For Clifford circuits, this extraction procedure yields a new normal form that is both asymptotically optimal in size and gives a new, smaller upper bound on gate depth for nearest-neighbour architectures.

In geometric quantum machine learning, one achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum circuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However, constructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has yet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of directed tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2) equivariant quantum circuit ans\\\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation symmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action, these networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised equivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically equivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and generalised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The efficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state problem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular lattice and on the Kagome lattice.

In the end, we have to let go of the notion of a one-to-one correspondence. We emphasize that the KAK decomposition traditionally favored by mathematicians is merely one coordinate system on the symmetric space, albeit a beautiful one. However, other matrix factorizations, especially the generalized singular value decomposition from numerical linear algebra, reveal themselves to be perfectly valid coordinate systems that one symmetric space can lead to many classical random matrix theories. We establish the connection between this numerical linear algebra viewpoint and the theory of generalized Cartan decompositions.

By encoding the variational parameters directly as hardware pulse amplitudes and durations we succeed in further shortening the pulse schedule and overall circuit duration. This decreases the impact of qubit decoherence and gate noise. As a demonstration, we apply our pulse-based variational algorithm to the calculation of the ground state of different hydrogen-based molecules (H$_2$, H$_3$ and H$_4$) using IBM cross-resonance-based hardware. We observe a reduction in schedule duration of up to $5\\times$ compared to CNOT-based Ans\\\"atze, while also reducing the measured energy. In particular, we observe a sizable improvement of the minimal energy configuration of H$_3$ compared to a CNOT-based variational form.

I hope to convince the reader that these topics have many points of contact and that in being treated together, they enrich each other. Entropy, in its various guises, is their common core. The large deviation theory which is developed in this book focuses upon convergence properties of certain stochastic systems. An elementary example is the weak law of large numbers. For each positive e, P{ISn/nl 2: e} con verges to zero as n --+ 00, where Sn is the nth partial sum of indepen dent identically distributed random variables with zero mean. Large deviation theory shows that if the random variables are exponentially bounded, then the probabilities converge to zero exponentially fast as n --+ 00. The exponen tial decay allows one to prove the stronger property of almost sure conver gence (Sn/n --+ 0 a.s.). This example will be generalized extensively in the book. We will treat a large class of stochastic systems which involve both indepen dent and dependent random variables and which have the following features: probabilities converge to zero exponentially fast as the size of the system increases; the exponential decay leads to strong convergence properties of the system. The most fascinating aspect of the theory is that the exponential decay rates are computable in terms of entropy functions. This identification between entropy and decay rates of large deviation probabilities enhances the theory significantly.","author":[{"family":"Ellis","given":"Richard S."}],"citation-key":"ellis2012","ISBN":"978-1-4613-8533-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,6]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"372","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Entropy, Large Deviations, and Statistical Mechanics","type":"book"},

The problem rather resides in a number of misconceptions leading to the representation of spacetime as a timeless Block Universe. The physical expanding universe is in fact an Evolving Block Universe with a time-dependent future boundary. This establishes a global direction of time that determines local arrows of time. Furthermore time passes when quantum wave function collapse takes place; during this process, information is lost.

  {"id":"erbin2021","abstract":"This textbook provides an introduction to string field theory (SFT). String theory is usually formulated in the worldsheet formalism, which describes a single string (first-quantization). While this approach is intuitive and could be pushed far due to the exceptional properties of two-dimensional theories, it becomes cumbersome for some questions or even fails at a more fundamental level. These motivations have led to the development of SFT, a description of string theory using the field theory formalism (second-quantization). As a field theory, SFT provides a rigorous and constructive formulation of string theory. The main focus of the book is the construction of the closed bosonic SFT. The accent is put on providing the reader with the foundations, conceptual understanding and intuition of what SFT is. After reading this book, the reader is able to study the applications from the literature. The book is organized in two parts. The first part reviews the notions of the worldsheet theory that are necessary to build SFT (worldsheet path integral, CFT and BRST quantization). The second part starts by introducing general concepts of SFT from the BRST quantization. Then, it introduces off-shell string amplitudes before providing a Feynman diagrams interpretation from which the building blocks of SFT are extracted. After constructing the closed SFT, the author outlines the proofs of several important properties such as background independence, unitarity and crossing symmetry. Finally, the generalization to the superstring is also discussed.","author":[{"family":"Erbin","given":"Harold"}],"citation-key":"erbin2021","ISBN":"978-3-030-65321-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,26]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"424","publisher":"Springer Nature","source":"Google Books","title":"String Field Theory: A Modern Introduction","title-short":"String Field Theory","type":"book"},

  {"id":"evans2002","abstract":"The question of how reversible microscopic equations of motion can lead to irreversible macroscopic behaviour has been one of the central issues in statistical mechanics for more than a century. The basic issues were known to Gibbs. Boltzmann conducted a very public debate with Loschmidt and others without a satisfactory resolution. In recent decades there has been no real change in the situation. In 1993 we discovered a relation, subsequently known as the Fluctuation Theorem (FT), which gives an analytical expression for the probability of observing Second Law violating dynamical fluctuations in thermostatted dissipative non-equilibrium systems. The relation was derived heuristically and applied to the special case of dissipative non-equilibrium systems subject to constant energy 'thermostatting'. These restrictions meant that the full importance of the Theorem was not immediately apparent. Within a few years, derivations of the Theorem were improved but it has only been in the last few of years that the generality of the Theorem has been appreciated. We now know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics can be derived assuming ergodicity at equilibrium, and causality. We take the assumption of causality to be axiomatic. It is causality which ultimately is responsible for breaking time reversal symmetry and which leads to the possibility of irreversible macroscopic behaviour. The Fluctuation Theorem does much more than merely prove that in large systems observed for long periods of time, the Second Law is overwhelmingly likely to be valid. The Fluctuation Theorem quantifies the probability of observing Second Law violations in small systems observed for a short time. Unlike the Boltzmann equation, the FT is completely consistent with Loschmidt's observation that for time reversible dynamics, every dynamical phase space trajectory and its conjugate time reversed 'anti-trajectory', are both solutions of the underlying equations of motion. Indeed the standard proofs of the FT explicitly consider conjugate pairs of phase space trajectories. Quantitative predictions made by the Fluctuation Theorem regarding the probability of Second Law violations have been confirmed experimentally, both using molecular dynamics computer simulation and very recently in laboratory experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Evans","given":"Denis J."},{"family":"Searles","given":"Debra J."}],"citation-key":"evans2002","container-title":"Advances in Physics","DOI":"10.1080/00018730210155133","ISSN":"0001-8732","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",11,1]]},"page":"1529-1585","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Fluctuation Theorem","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00018730210155133","volume":"51"},

Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems—from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor’s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fawzi","given":"Alhussein"},{"family":"Balog","given":"Matej"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Aja"},{"family":"Hubert","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Romera-Paredes","given":"Bernardino"},{"family":"Barekatain","given":"Mohammadamin"},{"family":"Novikov","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"R.

  {"id":"ferrer-sanchez2023","abstract":"We introduce a novel methodology that leverages the strength of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to address the counterdiabatic (CD) protocol in the optimization of quantum circuits comprised of systems with $N_{Q}$ qubits. The primary objective is to utilize physics-inspired deep learning techniques to accurately solve the time evolution of the different physical observables within the quantum system. To accomplish this objective, we embed the necessary physical information into an underlying neural network to effectively tackle the problem. In particular, we impose the hermiticity condition on all physical observables and make use of the principle of least action, guaranteeing the acquisition of the most appropriate counterdiabatic terms based on the underlying physics. The proposed approach offers a dependable alternative to address the CD driving problem, free from the constraints typically encountered in previous methodologies relying on classical numerical approximations. Our method provides a general framework to obtain optimal results from the physical observables relevant to the problem, including the external parameterization in time known as scheduling function, the gauge potential or operator involving the non-adiabatic terms, as well as the temporal evolution of the energy levels of the system, among others. The main applications of this methodology have been the $\\mathrm{H_{2}}$ and $\\mathrm{LiH}$ molecules, represented by a 2-qubit and 4-qubit systems employing the STO-3G basis.

We then construct cubic vertices for the full double-copy multiplet, comprising a graviton, a two-form and a scalar particle, by means of the Noether procedure. Both at the free and at the cubic level the result gets uniquely ﬁxed only upon imposing, on top of gauge invariance, a left-right Lorentz symmetry ruling contraction of indices among double-copy ﬁelds.

  {"id":"fewster2023","abstract":"The topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in this article. Some of the long standing problems of this subject are highlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of the wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible measurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the perspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is described in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and another quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical coupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for the induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the concept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the result of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic causality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of the wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is resolved. Finally, there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and other related work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fewster","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Verch","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"fewster2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.13356","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.13356","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Measurement in Quantum Field Theory","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13356"},

This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed by the existence of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $\\textnormal{II}_1$ factor.

Measurements of observables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables in the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state of the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the conditions may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT). The induced system observables corresponding to probe observables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. A formula is given for the post-selected system state, conditioned on measurement outcomes, which is closely related to the notion of an instrument as introduced by Davies and Lewis. This formula has the important property that individual measurements form consistent composites, provided that their coupling regions can be causally ordered and a certain causal factorisation property holds for the dynamics; the composite is independent of the causal order chosen if more than one exists.

  {"id":"fewsterQuantumFieldsLocal2020","abstract":"The measurement process is considered for quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. Measurements are carried out on one QFT, the \"system\", using another, the \"probe\" via a dynamical coupling of \"system\" and \"probe\" in a bounded spacetime region. The resulting \"coupled theory\" determines a scattering map on the uncoupled combination of the \"system\" and \"probe\" by reference to natural \"in\" and \"out\" spacetime regions. No specific interaction is assumed and all constructions are local and covariant. Given any initial probe state in the \"in\" region, the scattering map determines a completely positive map from \"probe\" observables in the \"out\" region to \"induced system observables\", thus providing a measurement scheme for the latter. It is shown that the induced system observables may be localized in the causal hull of the interaction coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. Post-selected states conditioned on measurement outcomes are obtained using Davies-Lewis instruments. Composite measurements involving causally ordered coupling regions are also considered. Provided that the scattering map obeys a causal factorization property, the causally ordered composition of the individual instruments coincides with the composite instrument; in particular, the instruments may be combined in either order if the coupling regions are causally disjoint. This is the central consistency property of the proposed framework. The general concepts and results are illustrated by an example in which both \"system\" and \"probe\" are quantized linear scalar fields, coupled by a quadratic interaction term with compact spacetime support. System observables induced by simple probe observables are calculated exactly, for sufficiently weak coupling, and compared with first order perturbation theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fewster","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Verch","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"fewsterQuantumFieldsLocal2020","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1810.06512","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,24]]},"number":"arXiv:1810.06512","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum fields and local measurements","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06512"},

They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quan- tum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC.

Contrary to claims, which are examined and rebutted, that quantum theory employs a nonclassical probability theory based on a nonclassical \"logic,\" the probabilistic framework set out here is entirely classical and the \"logic\" used is Boolean. The framework consists of a set of states and a set of quantities that are interrelated in a specified manner. Each state induces a classical probability space on the values of each quantity. The quantities, so considered, become statistical variables (not random variables). Such variables need not have a \"joint distribution.\" For the quantum theoretic application, there is a uniform procedure that defines and determines the existence of such \"joint distributions\" for statistical variables. A general rule is provided and it is shown to lead to the usual compatibility-commutivity requirements of quantum theory.

In Mellin space, CFT correlators have poles corresponding to an OPE decomposition into `left' and `right' sub-correlators, in direct analogy with the factorization channels of scattering amplitudes. In the regime where these correlators can be computed by tree level Witten diagrams in AdS, we derive an explicit formula for the residues of Mellin amplitudes at the corresponding factorization poles, and we use the conformal Casimir to show that these amplitudes obey algebraic finite difference equations. By analyzing the recursive structure of our factorization formula we obtain simple diagrammatic rules for the construction of Mellin amplitudes corresponding to tree-level Witten diagrams in any bulk scalar theory. We prove the diagrammatic rules using our finite difference equations. Finally, we show that our factorization formula and our diagrammatic rules morph into the flat space S-Matrix of the bulk theory, reproducing the usual Feynman rules, when we take the flat space limit of AdS/CFT. Throughout we emphasize a deep analogy with the properties of flat space scattering amplitudes in momentum space, which suggests that the Mellin amplitude may provide a holographic definition of the flat space S-Matrix.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Fitzpatrick","given":"A.

  {"id":"fletcher2007","abstract":"Quantum error correction (QEC) is an essential element of physical quantum information processing systems. Most QEC efforts focus on extending classical error correction schemes to the quantum regime. The input to a noisy system is embedded in a coded subspace, and error recovery is performed via an operation designed to perfectly correct for a set of errors, presumably a large subset of the physical noise process. In this paper, we examine the choice of recovery operation. Rather than seeking perfect correction on a subset of errors, we seek a recovery operation to maximize the entanglement fidelity for a given input state and noise model. In this way, the recovery operation is optimum for the given encoding and noise process. This optimization is shown to be calculable via a semidefinite program (SDP), a well-established form of convex optimization with efficient algorithms for its solution. The error recovery operation may also be interpreted as a combining operation following a quantum spreading channel, thus providing a quantum analogy to the classical diversity combining operation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Andrew S."},{"family":"Shor","given":"Peter W."},{"family":"Win","given":"Moe Z."}],"citation-key":"fletcher2007","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"fritz2017","abstract":"Resources and their use and consumption form a central part of our life. Many branches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which given resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For example, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication channel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum information theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of question. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility of combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered commutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where chemical reaction equations such as\n \nare concerned both with a convertibility relation ‘→’ and a combination operation ‘+.’ We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and functional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should have applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of conversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are also of purely mathematical interest without the resource-theoretic interpretation, we exemplify our results with the ordered commutative monoid of graphs.While closely related to both Girard's linear logic and to Deutsch's constructor theory, our framework also produces results very reminiscent of the utility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern in decision theory and of a theorem of Lieb and Yngvason on the foundations of thermodynamics.Concerning pure algebra, our observation is that some pieces of algebra can be developed in a context in which equality is not necessarily symmetric, i.e. in which the equality relation is replaced by an ordering relation. For example, notions like cancellativity or torsion-freeness are still sensible and very natural concepts in our ordered setting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fritz","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"fritz2017","container-title":"Mathematical Structures in Computer Science","DOI":"10.1017/S0960129515000444","ISSN":"0960-1295, 1469-8072","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"850-938","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Resource convertibility and ordered commutative monoids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/resource-convertibility-and-ordered-commutative-monoids/C0D57AE7683BAA911F3F270ABD82A4E9","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"frolov2023","abstract":"This is a non-standard exposition of main notions of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory that also includes some recent results. It is based on algebraic approach where the starting point is an associative algebra with involution and states are defined as positive linear functionals on this algebra and on geometric approach where the starting point is a set of states considered as a convex subset of linear space. The exposition does not depend on textbooks in quantum mechanics. Standard formulas for quantum probabilities are derived from decoherence. This derivation allows us to go beyond quantum theory in geometric approach. Particles are defined as elementary excitations of ground state (and quasiparticles as elementary excitations of any translation invariant state). It follows from this definition that the notion of identical particles is very natural. The scattering of particles is analyzed in the framework of generalization of Haag-Ruelle theory. The conventional scattering matrix does not work for quasiparticles (and even for particles if the theory does not have particle interpretation). The analysis of scattering in these cases is based on the notion of inclusive scattering matrix, closely related to inclusive cross-sections. It is proven that the conventional scattering matrix can be expressed in terms of Green functions (LSZ formula) anf inclusive scattering matrix can be expressed in terms of generalized Green functions that appear in the Keldysh formalism of non-equilibrium statistical physics. It is shown that generalized Green functions and inclusive scattering matrices appear also in the formalism of L-functionals that can be identified with positive functionals on Weyl or Clifford algebras. The derivation of the expression of the evolution operator and other physical quantities in terms of functional integrals is based on the notion of symbol of operator; these arguments can be applied also in geometric approach. This result can be used, in particular, to give a simple derivation of diagram technique for generalized Green functions. The notion of inclusive scattering matrix makes sense in geometric approach (but it seems that one cannot give a definition of conventional scattering matrix in this situation). The geometric approach is used to show that quantum mechanics and its generalizations can be considered as classical theories where our devices are able to measure only a part of observables.

Since this goal is shared by quite a few other books, we should explain in this Preface how our approach differs, although the potential reader can probably see this better by a quick browse through the book. Representation theory is simple to define: it is the study of the ways in which a given group may act on vector spaces. It is almost certainly unique, however, among such clearly delineated subjects, in the breadth of its interest to mathematicians. This is not surprising: group actions are ubiquitous in 20th century mathematics, and where the object on which a group acts is not a vector space, we have learned to replace it by one that is {e. g. , a cohomology group, tangent space, etc. }. As a consequence, many mathematicians other than specialists in the field {or even those who think they might want to be} come in contact with the subject in various ways. It is for such people that this text is designed. To put it another way, we intend this as a book for beginners to learn from and not as a reference. This idea essentially determines the choice of material covered here. As simple as is the definition of representation theory given above, it fragments considerably when we try to get more specific.","author":[{"family":"Fulton","given":"William"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Joe"}],"citation-key":"fulton1991","ISBN":"978-0-387-97495-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"574","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Representation Theory: A First Course","title-short":"Representation Theory","type":"book"},

Zadeh in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.\nAt the same time, Salii (1965) defined a more general kind of structure called an L-relation, which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are now used throughout fuzzy mathematics and have applications in areas such as linguistics (De Cock, Bodenhofer & Kerre 2000), decision-making (Kuzmin 1982), and clustering (Bezdek 1978), are special cases of L-relations when L is the unit interval [0, 1].\nIn classical set theory, the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition—an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval [0, 1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the indicator functions (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only takes values 0 or 1. In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called crisp sets.

  {"id":"gall2022","abstract":"The study of distributed interactive proofs was initiated by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena [PODC 2018] as a generalization of distributed decision mechanisms (proof-labeling schemes, etc.), and has received a lot of attention in recent years. In distributed interactive proofs, the nodes of an $n$-node network $G$ can exchange short messages (called certificates) with a powerful prover. The goal is to decide if the input (including $G$ itself) belongs to some language, with as few turns of interaction and as few bits exchanged between nodes and the prover as possible. There are several results showing that the size of certificates can be reduced drastically with a constant number of interactions compared to non-interactive distributed proofs. In this paper, we introduce the quantum counterpart of distributed interactive proofs: certificates can now be quantum bits, and the nodes of the network can perform quantum computation. The first result of this paper shows that by using quantum distributed interactive proofs, the number of interactions can be significantly reduced. More precisely, our result shows that for any constant~$k$, the class of languages that can be decided by a $k$-turn classical (i.e., non-quantum) distributed interactive protocol with $f(n)$-bit certificate size is contained in the class of languages that can be decided by a $5$-turn distributed quantum interactive protocol with $O(f(n))$-bit certificate size. We also show that if we allow to use shared randomness, the number of turns can be reduced to 3-turn. Since no similar turn-reduction \\emph{classical} technique is currently known, our result gives evidence of the power of quantum computation in the setting of distributed interactive proofs as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gall","given":"François Le"},{"family":"Miyamoto","given":"Masayuki"},{"family":"Nishimura","given":"Harumichi"}],"citation-key":"gall2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2210.01390","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,4]]},"number":"arXiv:2210.01390","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Distributed Quantum Interactive Proofs","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01390"},

The dynamical structure is the set of pure states together with the action of the reversible dynamics, whilst the probabilistic structure determines the measurements and the outcome probabilities. For transitive dynamical structures whose dynamical group and stabiliser subgroup form a Gelfand pair we show that all probabilistic structures are rigid (cannot be infinitesimally deformed) and are in one-to-one correspondence with the spherical representations of the dynamical group. We apply our methods to classify all probabilistic structures when the dynamical structure is that of complex Grassmann manifolds acted on by the unitary group. This is a generalisation of quantum theory where the pure states, instead of being represented by one-dimensional subspaces of a complex vector space, are represented by subspaces of a fixed dimension larger than one. We also show that systems with compact two-point homogeneous dynamical structures (i.e. every pair of pure states with a given distance can be reversibly transformed to any other pair of pure states with the same distance), which include systems corresponding to Euclidean Jordan Algebras, all have rigid probabilistic structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Galley","given":"Thomas D."},{"family":"Masanes","given":"Lluis"}],"citation-key":"galley2020","container-title":"arXiv.org","DOI":"10.22331/q-2021-05-21-457","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,12]]},"language":"en","title":"How dynamics constrains probabilities in general probabilistic theories","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05088v3"},

Fundamentally, this tension should result in breaking one of the fundamental principles of quantum theory or general relativity, but it is usually hard to assess which one without resorting to a specific model. Here, we answer this question in a theory-independent way using General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs). We consider the interactions of the gravitational field with a single matter system, and derive a no-go theorem showing that when gravity is classical at least one of the following assumptions needs to be violated: (i) Matter degrees of freedom are described by fully non-classical degrees of freedom; (ii) Interactions between matter degrees of freedom and the gravitational field are reversible; (iii) Matter degrees of freedom back-react on the gravitational field. We argue that this implies that theories of classical gravity and quantum matter must be fundamentally irreversible, as is the case in the recent model of Oppenheim et al. Conversely if we require that the interaction between quantum matter and the gravitational field is reversible, then the gravitational field must be non-classical.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Galley","given":"Thomas D."},{"family":"Giacomini","given":"Flaminia"},{"family":"Selby","given":"John H."}],"citation-key":"galley2023","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2023-10-16-1142","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,16]]},"language":"en","page":"1142","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Any consistent coupling between classical gravity and quantum matter is fundamentally irreversible","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10261","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"gao2021a","abstract":"Demonstrating quantum advantage requires experimental implementation of a computational task that is hard to achieve using state-of-the-art classical systems. One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution associated with a class of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. It has been suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a \"benign\" setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is assumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the fidelity. Second, in an \"adversarial\" setting where all possible classical algorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively high XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We present an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields high XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying and exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values without full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features better scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly studied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our algorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in which the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We illustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits in various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of noise. Our results show that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on several conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be assumed in the adversarial setting. Thus, the XEB alone has limited utility as a benchmark for quantum advantage. We discuss ways to overcome these limitations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Xun"},{"family":"Kalinowski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Chou","given":"Chi-Ning"},{"family":"Lukin","given":"Mikhail D."},{"family":"Barak","given":"Boaz"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Soonwon"}],"citation-key":"gao2021a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"number":"arXiv:2112.01657","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Limitations of Linear Cross-Entropy as a Measure for Quantum Advantage","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657"},

Ben-Menahem and I. Pitowsky [1] Abstract The basic motivation behind the present text is threefold: To give a new explanation for the emergence of thermodynamics, to investigate the interplay between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, and to explore possible ext- sions of the common validity range of thermodynamics. Originally, thermodynamics has been a purely phenomenological science. Early s- entists (Galileo, Santorio, Celsius, Fahrenheit) tried to give de?nitions for quantities which were intuitively obvious to the observer, like pressure or temperature, and studied their interconnections. The idea that these phenomena might be linked to other ?elds of physics, like classical mechanics, e.g., was not common in those days. Such a connection was basically introduced when Joule calculated the heat equ- alent in 1840 showing that heat was a form of energy, just like kinetic or potential energy in the theory of mechanics. At the end of the 19th century, when the atomic theory became popular, researchers began to think of a gas as a huge amount of bouncing balls inside a box.","author":[{"family":"Gemmer","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Michel","given":"M."},{"family":"Mahler","given":"Günter"}],"citation-key":"gemmer2009","ISBN":"978-3-540-70510-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7,14]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"338","publisher":"Springer","source":"Google Books","title":"Quantum Thermodynamics: Emergence of Thermodynamic Behavior Within Composite Quantum Systems","title-short":"Quantum Thermodynamics","type":"book"},

Here, we add strong support to the relational concept of time by deriving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for a system from an energy eigenstate of the global Hamiltonian consisting of system, environment and their interaction. Our results are consistent with concepts for the emergence of time where interaction has been taken into account at the expense of a semiclassical treatment of the environment.

  {"id":"giddings2022","abstract":"This paper sets up a perturbative treatment of the evolving quantum state of a gravitational system, in a Schr\\\"odinger-like picture, working about a general background. This connects gauge symmetry, the constraints, gravitational dressing, and evolution. Starting with a general time slicing, we give a simple derivation of the relation between the constraints, the hamiltonian, and its well-known boundary term. Among different approaches to quantization with constraints, we focus on a \"gauge-invariant canonical quantization,\" which is developed perturbatively in the gravitational coupling. The leading-order solution of the constraints (including the \"Wheeler-DeWitt equation\") for perturbations about the background is given in terms of an explicit construction of gravitational dressings built using certain generalized Green functions; different such dressings corresponding to adding propagating gravitational waves to a particular solution of the constraints. Dressed operators commute with the constraints, expressing their gauge invariance, and have an algebraic structure differing significantly from the undressed operators of the underlying field theory. These operators can act on the vacuum to create dressed states, and evolution of general such states is then generated by the boundary hamiltonian, and alternately may be described in terms of other relational observables.

With no foreknowledge, Stim can analyze a distance 100 surface code circuit (20 thousand qubits, 8 million gates, 1 million measurements) in 15 seconds and then begin sampling full circuit shots at a rate of 1 kHz. Stim uses a stabilizer tableau representation, similar to Aaronson and Gottesman's CHP simulator, but with three main improvements. First, Stim improves the asymptotic complexity of deterministic measurement from quadratic to linear by tracking the {\\em inverse} of the circuit's stabilizer tableau. Second, Stim improves the constant factors of the algorithm by using a cache-friendly data layout and 256 bit wide SIMD instructions. Third, Stim only uses expensive stabilizer tableau simulation to create an initial reference sample. Further samples are collected in bulk by using that sample as a reference for batches of Pauli frames propagating through the circuit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Gidney","given":"Craig"}],"citation-key":"gidneyStimFastStabilizer2021","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2021-07-06-497","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,6]]},"page":"497","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Stim: a fast stabilizer circuit simulator","title-short":"Stim","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02202","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"gilyen2019","abstract":"Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number of qubits present in the system. We develop a new \"Singular value transformation\" algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage, that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a certain \"non-commutative\" measurement problem and propose a new method for singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to efficiently implement principal component regression. \"Singular value transformation\" is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups. We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which often gives optimal bounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilyén","given":"András"},{"family":"Su","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Low","given":"Guang Hao"},{"family":"Wiebe","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"gilyen2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 51st Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing","DOI":"10.1145/3313276.3316366","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,23]]},"page":"193-204","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum singular value transformation and beyond: exponential improvements for quantum matrix arithmetics","title-short":"Quantum singular value transformation and beyond","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01838"},

  {"id":"giri2024","abstract":"The celebrated Aharonov-Bohm effect is perhaps the first example in which the the interplay between classical topology and quantum theory was explored. This connection has continued to shed light on diverse areas of physics like quantum statistics, anomalies, condensed matter physics, and gauge theories. Several attempts were made to generalize the Aharonov-Bohm effect by modifying the simple solenoidal current distribution used by them to the case of multiple solenoids, and a toroidal solenoid, for example. A particularly ambitious task is to confine the magnetic flux to the interior of a knotted solenoid. While it is to be expected that a non-trivial phase factor will be picked up by the wave function of a charged particle travelling in the complement of the knot in three-dimensional space, the lack of symmetry defied attempts to explicitly solve the associated scattering problem. In this paper we report on a way to make progress towards this problem based on multipole expansions. The vector potential produced by a knot is obtained by making a multipole expansion, which is then used to calculate the S-matrix for the scattering of the charged particle, in the Born approximation. It is found that the S-matrix carries an imprint of the knottedness at the octopole order. For the case of a torus knot, a curious factorization property is seen to hold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Giri","given":"Kaustav"},{"family":"Sreedhar","given":"V.

To provide a fuller discussion of coherence, a succession of correlation functions for the complex field strengths is defined. The nth order function expresses the correlation of values of the fields at 2n different points of space and time. Certain values of these functions are measurable by means of n-fold delayed coincidence detection of photons. A fully coherent field is defined as one whose correlation functions satisfy an infinite succession of stated conditions. Various orders of incomplete coherence are distinguished, according to the number of coherence conditions actually satisfied. It is noted that the fields historically described as coherent in optics have only first-order coherence. On the other hand, the existence, in principle, of fields coherent to all orders is shown both in quantum theory and classical theory. The methods used in these discussions apply to fields of arbitrary time dependence. It is shown, as a result, that coherence does not require monochromaticity.

  {"id":"glowacki2023","abstract":"The quantum reference frames program is based on the idea that reference frames should be treated as quantum physical systems. In this work, we combine these insights with the emphasis on operationality, understood as refraining from introducing into the framework objects not directly related to in principle verifiable probabilities of measurement outcomes, and identifying the setups indistinguishable as such. Based on intuitions from special relativity and gauge theory, we introduce an operational notion of a quantum reference frame -- which is defined as a quantum system equipped with a covariant positive operator-valued measure (POVM) -- and build a framework on the concept of operational equivalence that allows us to enforce operationality by quotienting the quantum state spaces with equivalence relation of indistinguishability by the available effects, assumed to be invariant under gauge transformations, and framed in the sense of respecting the choice of the frame's POVM. Such effects are accessed via the yen construction, which maps effects on the system to those on the composite system, satisfying gauge invariance and framing. They are called relative, and the classes of states indistinguishable by them are referred to as relative states. We show that when the frame is localizable, meaning that it allows for states that give rise to a highly localized probability distribution of the frame's observable, by restricting the relative description upon such localized frame preparation we recover the usual, non-relational formalism of quantum mechanics. We provide a consistent way of translating between different relative descriptions by means of frame-change maps and compare these with the corresponding notions in other approaches to QRF, establishing an operational agreement in the domain of common applicability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Głowacki","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"glowacki2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.07021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.07021","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Operational Quantum Frames: An operational approach to quantum reference frames","title-short":"Operational Quantum Frames","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07021"},

Our approach seeks to integrate Quantum Field Theory on curved backgrounds and scenarios with indefinite causality. Building on concepts from the operational approach to Quantum Reference Frames, we extend these ideas significantly. Specifically, we initiate the development of a general integration theory for operator-valued functions (quantum fields) with respect to positive operator-valued measures (quantum frames). This allows us to define quantum frames within the context of arbitrary principal bundles, replacing group structures. By considering Lorentz principal bundles, we enable a relational treatment of quantum fields on arbitrarily curved spacetimes. A~form of~indefinite spatiotemporality arises from quantum states in the context of frame bundles.

  {"id":"goodfellow2016","abstract":"An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.","author":[{"family":"Goodfellow","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Bengio","given":"Yoshua"},{"family":"Courville","given":"Aaron"}],"citation-key":"goodfellow2016","edition":"Illustrated edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-262-03561-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,18]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"800","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Amazon","title":"Deep Learning","type":"book"},

Using representation theory and invariant theory to analyze the symmetries that arise from group actions, and with strong emphasis on the geometry and basic theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, Symmetry, Representations, and Invariants is a significant reworking of an earlier highly-acclaimed work by the authors. The result is a comprehensive introduction to Lie theory, representation theory, invariant theory, and algebraic groups, in a new presentation that is more accessible to students and includes a broader range of applications.  The philosophy of the earlier book is retained, i.e., presenting the principal theorems of representation theory for the classical matrix groups as motivation for the general theory of reductive groups. The wealth of examples and discussion prepares the reader for the complete arguments now given in the general case.  Key Features of Symmetry, Representations, and Invariants: • Early chapters suitable for honors undergraduate or beginning graduate courses, requiring only linear algebra, basic abstract algebra, and advanced calculus • Applications to geometry (curvature tensors), topology (Jones polynomial via symmetry), and combinatorics (symmetric group and Young tableaux) • Self-contained chapters, appendices, comprehensive bibliography • More than 350 exercises (most with detailed hints for solutions) further explore main concepts • Serves as an excellent main text for a one-year course in Lie group theory • Benefits physicists as well as mathematicians as a reference work","author":[{"family":"Goodman","given":"Roe"},{"family":"Wallach","given":"Nolan R."}],"citation-key":"goodman2009","ISBN":"978-0-387-79852-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7,30]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"731","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Symmetry, Representations, and Invariants","type":"book"},
  {"id":"gorard2021","abstract":"This article presents a novel algorithmic methodology for performing automated diagrammatic deductions over combinatorial structures, using a combination of modified equational theorem-proving techniques and the extended Wolfram model hypergraph rewriting formalism developed by the authors in previous work. We focus especially upon the application of this new algorithm to the problem of automated circuit simplification in quantum information theory, using Wolfram model multiway operator systems combined with the ZX-calculus formalism for enacting fast diagrammatic reasoning over linear transformations between qubits. We show how to construct a generalization of the deductive inference rules for Knuth-Bendix completion in which equation matches are selected on the basis of causal edge density in the associated multiway system, before proceeding to demonstrate how to embed the higher-order logic of the ZX-calculus rules within this first-order equational framework. After showing explicitly how the (hyper)graph rewritings of both Wolfram model systems and the ZX-calculus can be effectively realized within this formalism, we proceed to exhibit comparisons of time complexity vs. proof complexity for this new algorithmic approach when simplifying randomly-generated Clifford circuits down to pseudo-normal form, as well as when reducing the number of T-gates in randomly-generated non-Clifford circuits, with circuit sizes ranging up to 3000 gates, illustrating that the method performs favorably in comparison with existing circuit simplification frameworks, and also exhibiting the approximately quadratic speedup obtained by employing the causal edge density optimization. Finally, we present a worked example of an automated proof of correctness for a simple quantum teleportation protocol, in order to demonstrate more clearly the internal operations of the theorem-proving procedure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Gorard","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Namuduri","given":"Manojna"},{"family":"Arsiwalla","given":"Xerxes D."}],"citation-key":"gorard2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2103.15820","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2103.15820","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"ZX-Calculus and Extended Wolfram Model Systems II: Fast Diagrammatic Reasoning with an Application to Quantum Circuit Simplification","title-short":"ZX-Calculus and Extended Wolfram Model Systems II","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15820"},

Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers - the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations. States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices.

  {"id":"gour2015","abstract":"We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state’s nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies, and that of quantifying the gap between the nonuniformity one must expend to achieve a single-shot state preparation or state conversion and the nonuniformity one can extract in the reverse operation. Quantum state-conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gour","given":"Gilad"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Markus P."},{"family":"Narasimhachar","given":"Varun"},{"family":"Spekkens","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Yunger Halpern","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"gour2015","collection-title":"The resource theory of informational nonequilibrium in thermodynamics","container-title":"Physics Reports","container-title-short":"Physics Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.physrep.2015.04.003","ISSN":"0370-1573","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-58","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The resource theory of informational nonequilibrium in thermodynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037015731500229X","volume":"583"},

A special feature is the authors' attention to rigorous mathematics: not everything is rigorous, but the need for rigour is explained at difficult junctures. The text is enriched by simple exercises, together with problems (with very brief hints) many of which are taken from final examinations at Cambridge and Oxford. The first eight chapters form a course in basic probability, being an account of events, random variables, and distributions - discrete and continuous random variables are treated separately - together with simple versions of the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. There is an account of moment generating functions and their applications. The following three chapters are about branching processes, random walks, and continuous-time random processes such as the Poisson process. The final chapter is a fairly extensive account of Markov chains in discrete time.

It is known that the AdS2 dual contains a tower of massive particles, yet there is at present no proposal for the bulk theory. As SYK is solvable in the 1/N expansion, one can systematically derive the bulk. We initiate such a program, by analyzing the fermion two, four and six-point functions, from which we extract the tower of singlet, large N dominant, operators, their dimensions, and their three-point correlation functions. These determine the masses of the bulk fields and their cubic couplings. We present these couplings, analyze their structure and discuss the simplifications that arise for large q.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gross","given":"David J."},{"family":"Rosenhaus","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"gross2017","container-title":"Journal of High Energy Physics","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"grossmann2023","abstract":"Partial differential equations play a fundamental role in the mathematical modelling of many processes and systems in physical, biological and other sciences. To simulate such processes and systems, the solutions of PDEs often need to be approximated numerically. The finite element method, for instance, is a usual standard methodology to do so. The recent success of deep neural networks at various approximation tasks has motivated their use in the numerical solution of PDEs. These so-called physics-informed neural networks and their variants have shown to be able to successfully approximate a large range of partial differential equations. So far, physics-informed neural networks and the finite element method have mainly been studied in isolation of each other. In this work, we compare the methodologies in a systematic computational study. Indeed, we employ both methods to numerically solve various linear and nonlinear partial differential equations: Poisson in 1D, 2D, and 3D, Allen-Cahn in 1D, semilinear Schr\\\"odinger in 1D and 2D. We then compare computational costs and approximation accuracies. In terms of solution time and accuracy, physics-informed neural networks have not been able to outperform the finite element method in our study. In some experiments, they were faster at evaluating the solved PDE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Grossmann","given":"Tamara G."},{"family":"Komorowska","given":"Urszula Julia"},{"family":"Latz","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Schönlieb","given":"Carola-Bibiane"}],"citation-key":"grossmann2023","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,8]]},"language":"en","title":"Can Physics-Informed Neural Networks beat the Finite Element Method?","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04107v1"},

The non-critical string theory is related to critical string theory in anti-deSitter background. We introduce a boundary of the anti-deSitter space analogous to a cut-off on the Liouville coordinate of the two-dimensional string theory. Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level n acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as 2ngYM2N1/2 for large `t Hooft coupling.

  {"id":"guth2023","abstract":"Partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain or random inputs have been considered in many studies of uncertainty quantification. In forward uncertainty quantification, one is interested in analyzing the stochastic response of the PDE subject to input uncertainty, which usually involves solving high-dimensional integrals of the PDE output over a sequence of stochastic variables. In practical computations, one typically needs to discretize the problem in several ways: approximating an infinite-dimensional input random field with a finite-dimensional random field, spatial discretization of the PDE using, e.g., finite elements, and approximating high-dimensional integrals using cubatures such as quasi-Monte Carlo methods. In this paper, we focus on the error resulting from dimension truncation of an input random field. We show how Taylor series can be used to derive theoretical dimension truncation rates for a wide class of problems and we provide a simple checklist of conditions that a parametric mathematical model needs to satisfy in order for our dimension truncation error bound to hold. Some of the novel features of our approach include that our results are applicable to non-affine parametric operator equations, dimensionally-truncated conforming finite element discretized solutions of parametric PDEs, and even compositions of PDE solutions with smooth nonlinear quantities of interest. As a specific application of our method, we derive an improved dimension truncation error bound for elliptic PDEs with lognormally parameterized diffusion coefficients. Numerical examples support our theoretical findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Guth","given":"Philipp A."},{"family":"Kaarnioja","given":"Vesa"}],"citation-key":"guth2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2209.06176","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Generalized dimension truncation error analysis for high-dimensional numerical integration: lognormal setting and beyond","title-short":"Generalized dimension truncation error analysis for high-dimensional numerical integration","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06176"},

This allows a purely algebraic formulation of the theory. The framework of an algebraic version of quantum field theory is discussed and compared to the customary operator approach. It is pointed out that one reason (and possibly the only one) for the existence of unitarily inequivalent faithful, irreducible representations in quantum field theory is the (physically irrelevant) behavior of the states with respect to observations made infinitely far away. The separation between such ``global'' features and the local ones is studied.

The evolution of generic quantum systems can be modelled by considering a collection of qubits subjected to sequences of random unitary gates. Here we investigate how the complexity of these random quantum circuits increases by considering how to construct a unitary operation from Haar-random two-qubit quantum gates. Implementing the unitary operation exactly requires a minimal number of gates—this is the operation’s exact circuit complexity. We prove a conjecture that this complexity grows linearly, before saturating when the number of applied gates reaches a threshold that grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Our proof overcomes difficulties in establishing lower bounds for the exact circuit complexity by combining differential topology and elementary algebraic geometry with an inductive construction of Clifford circuits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Haferkamp","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Faist","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Kothakonda","given":"Naga B.

First, it treats Lie groups (not just Lie alge bras) in a way that minimizes the amount of manifold theory needed. Thus, I neither assume a prior course on differentiable manifolds nor provide a con densed such course in the beginning chapters. Second, this book provides a gentle introduction to the machinery of semi simple groups and Lie algebras by treating the representation theory of SU(2) and SU(3) in detail before going to the general case. This allows the reader to see roots, weights, and the Weyl group \"in action\" in simple cases before confronting the general theory. The standard books on Lie theory begin immediately with the general case: a smooth manifold that is also a group. The Lie algebra is then defined as the space of left-invariant vector fields and the exponential mapping is defined in terms of the flow along such vector fields. This approach is undoubtedly the right one in the long run, but it is rather abstract for a reader encountering such things for the first time.","author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Brian C."}],"citation-key":"hall2003","ISBN":"978-0-387-40122-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",8,7]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"376","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction","title-short":"Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations","type":"book"},

In this sense, it fulfilled a long-held goal of theoretical physics (dating at least to Johann Bernoulli in the eighteenth century) of finding an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle.  The wave equation followed by mechanical systems is similar to, but not identical with, Schrödinger's equation, as described below; for this reason, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is considered the \"closest approach\" of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. The qualitative form of this connection is called Hamilton's optico-mechanical analogy.\nIn mathematics, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation is a necessary condition describing extremal geometry in generalizations of problems from the calculus of variations.

In the search for practical quantum applications, it is important to know how big the truncation errors can be. In general, it is not easy to estimate errors unless we have a good quantum computer. In this paper we show that traditional sampling methods on classical devices, speciﬁcally Markov Chain Monte Carlo, can address this issue with a reasonable amount of computational resources available today. As a demonstration, we apply this idea to the scalar ﬁeld theory on a two-dimensional lattice, with a size that goes beyond what is achievable using exact diagonalization methods.

  {"id":"hao2023","abstract":"Recent advances of data-driven machine learning have revolutionized fields like computer vision, reinforcement learning, and many scientific and engineering domains. In many real-world and scientific problems, systems that generate data are governed by physical laws. Recent work shows that it provides potential benefits for machine learning models by incorporating the physical prior and collected data, which makes the intersection of machine learning and physics become a prevailing paradigm. By integrating the data and mathematical physics models seamlessly, it can guide the machine learning model towards solutions that are physically plausible, improving accuracy and efficiency even in uncertain and high-dimensional contexts. In this survey, we present this learning paradigm called Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) which is to build a model that leverages empirical data and available physical prior knowledge to improve performance on a set of tasks that involve a physical mechanism. We systematically review the recent development of physics-informed machine learning from three perspectives of machine learning tasks, representation of physical prior, and methods for incorporating physical prior. We also propose several important open research problems based on the current trends in the field. We argue that encoding different forms of physical prior into model architectures, optimizers, inference algorithms, and significant domain-specific applications like inverse engineering design and robotic control is far from being fully explored in the field of physics-informed machine learning. We believe that the interdisciplinary research of physics-informed machine learning will significantly propel research progress, foster the creation of more effective machine learning models, and also offer invaluable assistance in addressing long-standing problems in related disciplines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hao","given":"Zhongkai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Songming"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yichi"},{"family":"Ying","given":"Chengyang"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Yao"},{"family":"Su","given":"Hang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"hao2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2211.08064","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2211.08064","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Physics-Informed Machine Learning: A Survey on Problems, Methods and Applications","title-short":"Physics-Informed Machine Learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08064"},
  {"id":"hardy2001","abstract":"The usual formulation of quantum theory is based on rather obscure axioms (employing complex Hilbert spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for calculating probabilities). In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory. Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or even just the word \"continuous\" from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from.

A renewed interest in the low-energy limit is driven by the prospect of new experiments that could probe this interface. Here we develop a covariant framework for expressing post-Newtonian corrections to Schr\\\"odinger's equation on arbitrary gravitational backgrounds based on a $1/c^2$ expansion of Lorentzian geometry, where $c$ is the speed of light. Our framework provides a generic coupling prescription of quantum systems to gravity that is valid in the intermediate regime between Newtonian gravity and General Relativity, and that retains the focus on geometry. At each order in $1/c^2$ this produces a nonrelativistic geometry to which quantum systems at that order couple. By considering the gauge symmetries of both the nonrelativistic geometries and the $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon field, we devise a prescription that allows us to derive the Schr\\\"odinger equation and its post-Newtonian corrections on a gravitational background order-by-order in $1/c^2$. We also demonstrate that these results can be obtained from a $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon Lagrangian. We illustrate our methods by performing the $1/c^2$ expansion of the Kerr metric up to $\\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$, which leads to a special case of the Hartle--Thorne metric.

  {"id":"hastie2001","abstract":"During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote apopular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.","author":[{"family":"Hastie","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Tibshirani","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Friedman","given":"Jerome H."}],"citation-key":"hastie2001","ISBN":"978-0-387-95284-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"560","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction","title-short":"The Elements of Statistical Learning","type":"book"},

  {"id":"haug2023","abstract":"Generalization is the ability of quantum machine learning models to make accurate predictions on new data by learning from training data. Here, we introduce the data quantum Fisher information metric (DQFIM) to determine when a model can generalize. For variational learning of unitaries, the DQFIM quantifies the amount of circuit parameters and training data needed to successfully train and generalize. We apply the DQFIM to explain when a constant number of training states and polynomial number of parameters are sufficient for generalization. Further, we can improve generalization by removing symmetries from training data. Finally, we show that out-of-distribution generalization, where training and testing data are drawn from different data distributions, can be better than using the same distribution. Our work opens up new approaches to improve generalization in quantum machine learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Haug","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Kim","given":"M.

  {"id":"hawking1973","abstract":"Einstein's General Theory of Relativity leads to two remarkable predictions: first, that the ultimate destiny of many massive stars is to undergo gravitational collapse and to disappear from view, leaving behind a 'black hole' in space; and secondly, that there will exist singularities in space-time itself. These singularities are places where space-time begins or ends, and the presently known laws of physics break down. They will occur inside black holes, and in the past are what might be construed as the beginning of the universe. To show how these predictions arise, the authors discuss the General Theory of Relativity in the large. Starting with a precise formulation of the theory and an account of the necessary background of differential geometry, the significance of space-time curvature is discussed and the global properties of a number of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations are examined. The theory of the causal structure of a general space-time is developed, and is used to study black holes and to prove a number of theorems establishing the inevitability of singualarities under certain conditions. A discussion of the Cauchy problem for General Relativity is also included in this 1973 book.","author":[{"family":"Hawking","given":"S. W."},{"family":"Ellis","given":"G. F.

  {"id":"hayashi2011","abstract":"Hayashi's Econometrics promises to be the next great synthesis of modern econometrics. It introduces first year Ph.D. students to standard graduate econometrics material from a modern perspective. It covers all the standard material necessary for understanding the principal techniques of econometrics from ordinary least squares through cointegration. The book is also distinctive in developing both time-series and cross-section analysis fully, giving the reader a unified framework for understanding and integrating results. Econometrics has many useful features and covers all the important topics in econometrics in a succinct manner. All the estimation techniques that could possibly be taught in a first-year graduate course, except maximum likelihood, are treated as special cases of GMM (generalized methods of moments). Maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of models (such as probit and tobit) are collected in a separate chapter. This arrangement enables students to learn various estimation techniques in an efficient manner. Eight of the ten chapters include a serious empirical application drawn from labor economics, industrial organization, domestic and international finance, and macroeconomics. These empirical exercises at the end of each chapter provide students a hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the chapter. The exposition is rigorous yet accessible to students who have a working knowledge of very basic linear algebra and probability theory. All the results are stated as propositions, so that students can see the points of the discussion and also the conditions under which those results hold. Most propositions are proved in the text. For those who intend to write a thesis on applied topics, the empirical applications of the book are a good way to learn how to conduct empirical research. For the theoretically inclined, the no-compromise treatment of the basic techniques is a good preparation for more advanced theory courses.","author":[{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Fumio"}],"citation-key":"hayashi2011","ISBN":"978-1-4008-2383-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,12]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"708","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Econometrics","type":"book"},

  {"id":"he2024","abstract":"The optimal control problem for open quantum systems can be formulated as a time-dependent Lindbladian that is parameterized by a number of time-dependent control variables. Given an observable and an initial state, the goal is to tune the control variables so that the expected value of some observable with respect to the final state is maximized. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving this optimal control problem efficiently, i.e., having a poly-logarithmic dependency on the system dimension, which is exponentially faster than best-known classical algorithms. Our algorithms are hybrid, consisting of both quantum and classical components. The quantum procedure simulates time-dependent Lindblad evolution that drives the initial state to the final state, and it also provides access to the gradients of the objective function via quantum gradient estimation. The classical procedure uses the gradient information to update the control variables. At the technical level, we provide the first (to the best of our knowledge) simulation algorithm for time-dependent Lindbladians with an $\\ell_1$-norm dependence. As an alternative, we also present a simulation algorithm in the interaction picture to improve the algorithm for the cases where the time-independent component of a Lindbladian dominates the time-dependent part. On the classical side, we heavily adapt the state-of-the-art classical optimization analysis to interface with the quantum part of our algorithms. Both the quantum simulation techniques and the classical optimization analyses might be of independent interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Wenhao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Tongyang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiantao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zecheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chunhao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ke"}],"citation-key":"he2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.19245","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Efficient Optimal Control of Open Quantum Systems","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19245"},

Recent developments of computational methods have enabled previously intractable chemical problems to be solved using rigorous quantum-mechanical methods.  This is the first comprehensive, up-to-date and technical work to cover all the important aspects of modern molecular electronic-structure theory. Topics covered in the book include: * Second quantization with spin adaptation  * Gaussian basis sets and molecular-integral evaluation  * Hartree-Fock theory  * Configuration-interaction and multi-configurational self-consistent theory  * Coupled-cluster theory for ground and excited states  * Perturbation theory for single- and multi-configurational states  * Linear-scaling techniques and the fast multipole method  * Explicity correlated wave functions  * Basis-set convergence and extrapolation  * Calibration and benchmarking of computational methods, with applications to moelcular equilibrium structure, atomization energies and reaction enthalpies. Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory makes extensive use of numerical examples, designed to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each method treated. In addition, statements about the usefulness and deficiencies of the various methods are supported by actual examples, not just model calculations. Problems and exercises are provided at the end of each chapter, complete with hints and solutions.

This text lays the foundation for this categorical quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the graphical calculus which makes computation intuitive. Biproducts and dual objects are introduced and used to model superposition and entanglement, with quantum teleportation studied abstractly using these structures. Monoids, Frobenius structures and Hopf algebras are described, and it is shown how they can be used to model classical information and complementary observables. The CP construction, a categorical tool to describe probabilistic quantum systems, is also investigated. The last chapter introduces higher categories, surface diagrams and 2-Hilbert spaces, and shows how the language of duality in monoidal 2-categories can be used to reason about quantum protocols, including quantum teleportation and dense coding.

  {"id":"horodecki2009","abstract":"All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say that what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in the laboratory. But the essence of quantum formalism—entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen, and Schrödinger—waited over 70years to enter laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, has potential for many quantum processes, including canonical ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and dense coding. However, it appears that this new resource is complex and difficult to detect. Although it is usually fragile to the environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation, and quantification. In particular, various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, and quantum cryptography are discussed, and some interrelations are pointed out. The basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within a distant laboratory paradigm is stressed, and some peculiarities such as the irreversibility of entanglement manipulations are also discussed including its extremal form—the bound entanglement phenomenon. The basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Horodecki","given":"Ryszard"},{"family":"Horodecki","given":"Paweł"},{"family":"Horodecki","given":"Michał"},{"family":"Horodecki","given":"Karol"}],"citation-key":"horodecki2009","container-title":"Reviews of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Rev.

The emphasis is on the temperature dependence of the INS spectra which were recorded using time-of-flight spectrometers. The hydrogen endofullerene system is highly quantum mechanical, exhibiting both translational and rotational quantization. The profound influence of the Pauli exclusion principle is revealed through nuclear spin isomerism.

  {"id":"houle2000","abstract":"Acid diffusion during postexposure baking is viewed to be a limiting factor in the extension of lithography using chemically amplified resists to formation of nanoscale features. Quantification of thermally activated reaction-diffusion kinetics in these materials is therefore an important step in understanding the extendability of this class of resist systems. Previous investigations have addressed this issue, however there is poor agreement among them, and too few data exist in the literature to allow the systematics of the effect of polymer, photoacid generator, added base or other resist components on the diffusion process to be understood. We describe in this article a combined experimental and modeling protocol that is designed to elucidate the chemistry and physics of the reaction-diffusion process. Because it is physically based, not phenomenological, it provides a means of developing a set of predictive, mutually comparable data that will allow new insights to be developed into the nanoscale behavior of chemically amplified resist materials. We apply the protocol to a p-t-butyloxycarbonyloxystyrene/bis(t-butylphenyl)iodonium perfluorobutanesulfonate positive-tone photoresist system. The resulting kinetics measurements show that diffusion is environment sensistive and describable with two limiting diffusion coefficients. The Arrhenius parameters for the coefficients in p-t-butyloxycarbonyloxystyrene are D0=1.9×108 cm2/s and Ea=36.5 kcal/mol; those for diffusion in the deprotected polymer product p-hydroxystyrene are D0=9×10−3 cm2/s and Ea=22.1 kcal/mol. The coefficients are much smaller than previously reported, resulting in a very slow diffusion rate. The model indicates that the considerable image spreading observed during the postexposure bake process is attributable primarily to the efficiency of the catalytic chemistry. Our results suggest that numerical models currently used for prediction of imaging in chemically amplified resists may require refinement in order to be useful for feature sizes below 100 nm and for new classes of resist systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Houle","given":"F.

  {"id":"howl2022","abstract":"It has been theorized that when a quantum communication protocol takes place near a black hole, the spacetime structure induced by the black hole causes an inescapable and fundamental degradation in the protocol's performance compared to if the protocol took place in flat spacetime. This is due to quantum information beyond the event horizon being inaccessible, introducing noise and degrading the entanglement resources of the protocol. However, despite black holes being a place where we expect quantum gravity to be integral, it has been assumed in these results that the black hole is a classical object with a classical spacetime. We show that when the quantum nature of a black hole and its spacetime are taken into account, their quantum properties can be used as resources to allay the degradation of entanglement caused by the event horizon, and thus improve the performance of quantum communication protocols near black holes.

The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians.

Unlike hard computing, soft computing is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximations. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the human mind. Soft computing is based on techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, machine learning, and expert systems. Although soft computing theory and techniques were first introduced in 1980s, it has now become a major research and study area in automatic control engineering. The techniques of soft computing are nowadays being used successfully in many domestic, commercial, and industrial applications. With the advent of the low-cost and very high performance digital processors and the reduction of the cost of memory chips it is clear that the techniques and application areas of soft computing will continue to expand.

It is shown that thermodynamic quantities largely depend upon the approach used to calculate them, the boundary conditions for the scalar fields and upon the regularization method.

In particular, state vector simulators, which store a full state vector in memory and update it in every quantum operation, are available to simulate an arbitrary form of quantum circuits, debug quantum applications, and validate future quantum computers. However, the time and space complexity grows exponentially with the number of qubits and easily exceeds the capability of a single machine. Therefore, we develop a distributed state vector simulator, $mpiQulacs$, that is optimized for large-scale simulation on A64FX-based cluster systems. A64FX is an ARM-based CPU that is also equipped in the world's top Fugaku supercomputer. We evaluate weak and strong scaling of mpiQulacs with up to 36 qubits on a new 64-node A64FX-based cluster system named $Todoroki$. By comparing mpiQulacs with existing distributed state vector simulators, we show that mpiQulacs achieves the highest performance for large-scale simulation on tens of nodes while sustaining a nearly ideal scalability. Besides, we define a new metric, $quantum B/F ratio$, and use it to demonstrate that mpiQulacs running on Todoroki fits the requirements of distributed state vector simulation rather than the existing simulators running on general purpose CPU-based or GPU-based cluster systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Imamura","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Masafumi"},{"family":"Honda","given":"Takumi"},{"family":"Kasagi","given":"Akihiko"},{"family":"Tabuchi","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Nakao","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Fukumoto","given":"Naoto"},{"family":"Nakashima","given":"Kohta"}],"citation-key":"imamura2022","container-title":"arXiv:2203.16044 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,30]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"mpiQulacs: A Distributed Quantum Computer Simulator for A64FX-based Cluster Systems","title-short":"mpiQulacs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16044"},

  {"id":"jafferis2022","abstract":"The holographic principle, theorized to be a property of quantum gravity, postulates that the description of a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary. The anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal field theory correspondence or duality1 is the principal example of holography. The Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model of N ≫ 1 Majorana fermions2,3 has features suggesting the existence of a gravitational dual in AdS2, and is a new realization of holography4–6. We invoke the holographic correspondence of the SYK many-body system and gravity to probe the conjectured ER=EPR relation between entanglement and spacetime geometry7,8 through the traversable wormhole mechanism as implemented in the SYK model9,10. A qubit can be used to probe the SYK traversable wormhole dynamics through the corresponding teleportation protocol9. This can be realized as a quantum circuit, equivalent to the gravitational picture in the semiclassical limit of an infinite number of qubits9. Here we use learning techniques to construct a sparsified SYK model that we experimentally realize with 164 two-qubit gates on a nine-qubit circuit and observe the corresponding traversable wormhole dynamics. Despite its approximate nature, the sparsified SYK model preserves key properties of the traversable wormhole physics: perfect size winding11–13, coupling on either side of the wormhole that is consistent with a negative energy shockwave14, a Shapiro time delay15, causal time-order of signals emerging from the wormhole, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics16,17.

It provides the basis for a variety of recent findings that significantly improve our understanding of the rich physical structure of quantum theory. This review paper tries to present the framework and recent results to a broader readership in an accessible manner. To achieve this, we follow a constructive approach. Starting from few basic physically motivated assumptions we show how a given set of observations can be manifested in an operational theory. Furthermore, we characterize consistency conditions limiting the range of possible extensions. In this framework classical and quantum theory appear as special cases, and the aim is to understand what distinguishes quantum mechanics as the fundamental theory realized in nature. It turns out non-classical features of single systems can equivalently result from higher dimensional classical theories that have been restricted. Entanglement and non-locality, however, are shown to be genuine non-classical features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Janotta","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hinrichsen","given":"Haye"}],"citation-key":"janottaGeneralizedProbabilityTheories2014","container-title":"Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"jauch2012","abstract":"Since the discovery of the corpuscular nature of radiation by Planck more than fifty years ago the quantum theory of radiation has gone through many stages of development which seemed to alternate between spectacular success and hopeless frustration. The most recent phase started in 1947 with the discovery of the electromagnetic level shifts and the realization that the exist ing theory, when properly interpreted, was perfectly adequate to explain these effects to an apparently unlimited degree of accuracy. This phase has now reached a certain conclusion: for the first time in the checkered history of this field of research it has become possible to give a unified and consistent presen tation of radiation theory in full conformity with the principles of relativity and quantum mechanics. To this task the present book is devoted. The plan for a book of this type was conceived during the year 1951 while the first-named author (J. M. J. ) held a Fulbright research scholarship at Cambridge University. During this year of freedom from teaching and other duties he had the opportunity of conferring with physicists in many different countries on the recent developments in radiation theory. The comments seemed to be almost unanimous that a book on quantum electrodynamics at the present time would be of inestimable value to physicists in many parts of the world.

Such hybrid systems have already shown the potential to tackle real-world tasks in supervised and generative learning, and recent works have established their provable advantages in special artificial tasks. Yet, in the case of reinforcement learning, which is arguably most challenging and where learning boosts would be extremely valuable, no proposal has been successful in solving even standard benchmarking tasks, nor in showing a theoretical learning advantage over classical algorithms. In this work, we achieve both. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning model using very few qubits, which we show can be effectively trained to solve several standard benchmarking environments. Moreover, we demonstrate, and formally prove, the ability of parametrized quantum circuits to solve certain learning tasks that are intractable for classical models, including current state-of-art deep neural networks, under the widely-believed classical hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jerbi","given":"Sofiene"},{"family":"Gyurik","given":"Casper"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"Simon C."},{"family":"Briegel","given":"Hans J."},{"family":"Dunjko","given":"Vedran"}],"citation-key":"jerbi2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,9]]},"number":"arXiv:2103.05577","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Parametrized quantum policies for reinforcement learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05577"},

  {"id":"jones1998","abstract":"In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Donald R."},{"family":"Schonlau","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Welch","given":"William J."}],"citation-key":"jones1998","container-title":"Journal of Global Optimization","container-title-short":"Journal of Global Optimization","DOI":"10.1023/A:1008306431147","ISSN":"1573-2916","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"455-492","source":"Springer Link","title":"Efficient Global Optimization of Expensive Black-Box Functions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008306431147","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"joo2021","abstract":"To solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is one of the most common but important tasks in not only basic sciences but also many practical industries. We here propose a quantum variational (QuVa) PDE solver with the aid of machine learning (ML) schemes to synergise two emerging technologies in mathematically hard problems. The core quantum processing in this solver is to calculate efficiently the expectation value of specially designed quantum operators. For a large quantum system, we only obtain data from measurements of few control qubits to avoid the exponential cost in the measurements of the whole quantum system and optimise a pathway to find possible solution sets of the desired PDEs using ML techniques. As an example, a few different types of the second-order DEs are examined with randomly chosen samples and a regression method is implemented to chase the best candidates of solution functions with another trial samples. We demonstrated that a three-qubit system successfully follows the pattern of analytical solutions of three different DEs with high fidelity since the variational solutions are given by a necessary condition to obtain the exact solution of the DEs. Thus, we believe that final solution candidate sets are efficiently extracted from the QuVa PDE solver with the support of ML techniques and this algorithm could be beneficial to search for the solutions of complex mathematical problems as well as to find good ansatzs for eigenstates in large quantum systems (e.g., for quantum chemistry).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Joo","given":"Jaewoo"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Hyungil"}],"citation-key":"joo2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2109.09216","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,19]]},"number":"arXiv:2109.09216","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum variational PDE solver with machine learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09216"},

It is thus very effective for solving problems that have a low-rank solution. The factorization $X=YY^T$ leads to a reformulation of the original problem as an optimization on a particular quotient manifold. The present paper discusses the geometry of that manifold and derives a second-order optimization method with guaranteed quadratic convergence. It furthermore provides some conditions on the rank of the factorization to ensure equivalence with the original problem.

  {"id":"kaheman2020","abstract":"Accurately modelling the nonlinear dynamics of a system from measurement data is a challenging yet vital topic. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm is one approach to discover dynamical systems models from data. Although extensions have been developed to identify implicit dynamics, or dynamics described by rational functions, these extensions are extremely sensitive to noise. In this work, we develop SINDy-PI (parallel, implicit), a robust variant of the SINDy algorithm to identify implicit dynamics and rational nonlinearities. The SINDy-PI framework includes multiple optimization algorithms and a principled approach to model selection. We demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to learn implicit ordinary and partial differential equations and conservation laws from limited and noisy data. In particular, we show that the proposed approach is several orders of magnitude more noise robust than previous approaches, and may be used to identify a class of ODE and PDE dynamics that were previously unattainable with SINDy, including for the double pendulum dynamics and simplified model for the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaheman","given":"Kadierdan"},{"family":"Kutz","given":"J.

  {"id":"kaiser2018","abstract":"The data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is currently pushing the frontiers of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control. However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks, require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit the use of these techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of model predictive control (MPC), based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable, generalizable, and reducing the burden of training data. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Eurika"},{"family":"Kutz","given":"J.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Karniadakis","given":"George Em"},{"family":"Kevrekidis","given":"Ioannis G."},{"family":"Lu","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Perdikaris","given":"Paris"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Sifan"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Liu"}],"citation-key":"karniadakis2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Physics","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Phys","DOI":"10.1038/s42254-021-00314-5","ISSN":"2522-5820","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"6","page":"422-440","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Physics-informed machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00314-5","volume":"3"},

In practice, error-mitigation techniques have already allowed encouraging progress on small lattices. In this work we focus on a truncated version of SU(2) gauge theory, which is a familiar non-Abelian step toward quantum chromodynamics. First, we demonstrate effective error mitigation for imaginary time evolution on a lattice having two square plaquettes, obtaining the ground state using an IBM quantum computer and observing that this would have been impossible without error mitigation. Then we propose the triamond lattice as an expedient approach to lattice gauge theories in three spatial dimensions, deriving the Hamiltonian and obtaining energy eigenvalues and eigenstates from a noiseless simulator for a three-dimensional unit cell.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kavaki","given":"Ali H.

  {"id":"kelly1980","abstract":"This work presents a detailed analysis of the combinatorics of modular operads. These are operad-like structures that admit a contraction operation as well as an operadic multiplication. Their combinatorics are governed by graphs that admit cycles, and are known for their complexity. In 2011, Joyal and Kock introduced a powerful graphical formalism for modular operads. This paper extends that work. A monad for modular operads is constructed and a corresponding nerve theorem is proved, using Weber's abstract nerve theory, in the terms originally stated by Joyal and Kock. This is achieved using a distributive law that sheds new light on the combinatorics of modular operads.\nDinatural transformations, which generalise the ubiquitous natural transformations to the case where the domain and codomain functors are of mixed variance, fail to compose in general; this has been known since they were discovered by Dubuc and Street in 1970. Many ad hoc solutions to this remarkable shortcoming have been found, but a general theory of compositionality was missing until Petrić, in 2003, introduced the concept of g-dinatural transformations, that is, dinatural transformations together with an appropriate graph: he showed how acyclicity of the composite graph of two arbitrary dinatural transformations is a sufficient and essentially necessary condition for the composite transformation to be in turn dinatural. Here we propose an alternative, semantic rather than syntactic, proof of Petrić's theorem, which the authors independently rediscovered with no knowledge of its prior existence; we then use it to define a generalised functor category, whose objects are functors of mixed variance in many variables, and whose morphisms are transformations that happen to be dinatural only in some of their variables.\nWe also define a notion of horizontal composition for dinatural transformations, extending the well-known version for natural transformations, and prove it is associative and unitary. Horizontal composition embodies substitution of functors into transformations and vice-versa, and is intuitively reflected from the string-diagram point of view by substitution of graphs into graphs.\nThis work represents the first, fundamental steps towards a substitution calculus for dinatural transformations as sought originally by Kelly, with the intention then to apply it to describe coherence problems abstractly. There are still fundamental difficulties that are yet to be overcome in order to achieve such a calculus, and these will be the subject of future work; however, our contribution places us well in track on the path traced by Kelly towards a calculus of substitution for dinatural transformations.\nA coherence result for symmetric monoidal closed categories with biproducts is shown in this paper. It is also explained how to prove coherence for compact closed categories with biproducts and for dagger compact closed categories with dagger biproducts by using the same technique.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"G.

This book presents a self-contained discussion of the concepts, methods and applications that can be expected in such a theory. The two main approaches to its construction — the direct quantisation of Einstein's general theory of relativity and string theory — are covered. Whereas the first attempts to construct a viable theory for the gravitational field alone, string theory assumes that a quantum theory of gravity will be achieved only through a unification of all the interactions. However, both employ the general method of quantization of constrained systems, which is described together with illustrative examples relevant for quantum gravity. There is a detailed presentation of the main approaches employed in quantum general relativity: path-integral quantization, the background-field method and canonical quantum gravity in the metric, connection and loop formulations. The discussion of string theory centres around its quantum-gravitational aspects and the comparison with quantum general relativity. Physical applications discussed at length include the quantization of black holes, quantum cosmology, the indications of a discrete structure of spacetime, and the origin of irreversibility. This third edition contains new chapters or sections on quantum gravity phenomenology, Horava-Lifshitz quantum gravity, analogue gravity, the holographic principle, and affine quantum gravity.

Affine transformations and nonlinear activation functions, two key elements in neural networks, are enacted in the quantum network using Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates, respectively. The non-Gaussian gates provide both the nonlinearity and the universality of the model. Due to the structure of the CV model, the CV quantum neural network can encode highly nonlinear transformations while remaining completely unitary. We show how a classical network can be embedded into the quantum formalism and propose quantum versions of various specialized model such as convolutional, recurrent, and residual networks.

We first provide a precise characterisation of when it is consistent to treat a quantum subsystem classically in such a limit, namely: in any quantum state corresponding to a definite classical state in the classical limit, the reduced density matrix of the subsystem must be approximately proportional to a projection operator, and the projection operators for different classical subsystem states must obey an approximate mutual orthogonality condition. These are strong constraints on the entanglement structure of classical states. They generically give rise to fundamentally non-local classical degrees of freedom, which may nevertheless be accounted for using a completely local kinematical description, if one gauges this description in the right way. The mechanism we describe is very general, but for concreteness we exhibit a toy example involving three entangled spins at high angular momentum, and we also describe a significant group-theoretic generalisation of this toy example.

  {"id":"kitaev2002","abstract":"This book is an introduction to a new rapidly developing topic: the theory of quantum computing. It begins with the basics of classical theory of computation: Turing machines, Boolean circuits, parallel algorithms, probabilistic computation, NP-complete problems, and the idea of complexity of an algorithm. The second part of the book provides an exposition of quantum computation theory. It starts with the introduction of general quantum formalism (pure states, density matrices, andsuperoperators), universal gate sets and approximation theorems. Then the authors study various quantum computation algorithms: Grover's algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, and the Abelian hidden subgroup problem. In concluding sections, several related topics are discussed (parallel quantumcomputation, a quantum analog of NP-completeness, and quantum error-correcting codes). Rapid development of quantum computing started in 1994 with a stunning suggestion by Peter Shor to use quantum computation for factoring large numbers-an extremely difficult and time-consuming problem when using a conventional computer. Shor's result spawned a burst of activity in designing new algorithms and in attempting to actually build quantum computers. Currently, the progress is much more significantin the former: A sound theoretical basis of quantum computing is under development and many algorithms have been suggested. In this concise text, the authors provide solid foundations to the theory-in particular, a careful analysis of the quantum circuit model-and cover selected topics in depth. Someof the results have not appeared elsewhere while others improve on existing works. Included are a complete proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem with accurate algorithm complexity bounds, approximation of unitary operators by circuits of doubly logarithmic depth. Among other interesting topics are toric codes and their relation to the anyon approach to quantum computing. Prerequisites are very modest and include linear algebra, elements of group theory and probability, and the notion of a formalor an intuitive algorithm. This text is suitable for a course in quantum computation for graduate students in mathematics, physics, or computer science. More than 100 problems (most of them with complete solutions) and an appendix summarizing the necessary results are a very useful addition to thebook.

We consider a disk in the plane, with a smooth boundary of length L, large compared to the correlation length. In the ground state, by tracing out all degrees of freedom in the exterior of the disk, we obtain a marginal density operator ρ for the degrees of freedom in the interior. The von Neumann entropy of ρ, a measure of the entanglement of the interior and exterior variables, has the form S(ρ)=αL−γ+⋯, where the ellipsis represents terms that vanish in the limit L→∞. We show that −γ is a universal constant characterizing a global feature of the entanglement in the ground state. Using topological quantum field theory methods, we derive a formula for γ in terms of properties of the superselection sectors of the medium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitaev","given":"Alexei"},{"family":"Preskill","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"kitaev2006a","container-title":"Physical Review Letters","container-title-short":"Phys.

The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν=0 and ν=±1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on ν mod 16, whereas ν itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitaev","given":"Alexei"}],"citation-key":"kitaevAnyonsExactlySolved2006","collection-title":"January Special Issue","container-title":"Annals of Physics","container-title-short":"Annals of Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.aop.2005.10.005","ISSN":"0003-4916","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,1]]},"page":"2-111","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Anyons in an exactly solved model and beyond","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003491605002381","volume":"321"},

  {"id":"kleiner2007","abstract":"Prior to the nineteenth century, algebra meant the study of the solution of polynomial equations. By the twentieth century algebra came to encompass the study of abstract, axiomatic systems such as groups, rings, and fields. This presentation provides an account of the history of the basic concepts, results, and theories of abstract algebra. The development of abstract algebra was propelled by the need for new tools to address certain classical problems that appeared unsolvable by classical means. A major theme of the approach in this book is to show how abstract algebra has arisen in attempts to solve some of these classical problems, providing context from which the reader may gain a deeper appreciation of the mathematics involved. Key features: * Begins with an overview of classical algebra * Contains separate chapters on aspects of the development of groups, rings, and fields * Examines the evolution of linear algebra as it relates to other elements of abstract algebra * Highlights the lives and works of six notables: Cayley, Dedekind, Galois, Gauss, Hamilton, and especially the pioneering work of Emmy Noether * Offers suggestions to instructors on ways of integrating the history of abstract algebra into their teaching * Each chapter concludes with extensive references to the relevant literature Mathematics instructors, algebraists, and historians of science will find the work a valuable reference.

  {"id":"kleinert2009","abstract":"This is the fifth, expanded edition of the comprehensive textbook published in 1990 on the theory and applications of path integrals. It is the first book to explicitly solve path integrals of a wide variety of nontrivial quantum-mechanical systems, in particular the hydrogen atom. The solutions have been made possible by two major advances. The first is a new euclidean path integral formula which increases the restricted range of applicability of Feynman&#39;s time-sliced formula to include singular attractive 1/r- and 1/r2-potentials. The second is a new nonholonomic mapping principle carrying physical laws in flat spacetime to spacetimes with curvature and torsion, which leads to time-sliced path integrals that are manifestly invariant under coordinate transformations.  In addition to the time-sliced definition, the author gives a perturbative, coordinate-independent definition of path integrals, which makes them invariant under coordinate transformations. A consistent implementation of this property leads to an extension of the theory of generalized functions by defining uniquely products of distributions.  The powerful FeynmanKleinert variational approach is explained and developed systematically into a variational perturbation theory which, in contrast to ordinary perturbation theory, produces convergent results. The convergence is uniform from weak to strong couplings, opening a way to precise evaluations of analytically unsolvable path integrals in the strong-coupling regime where they describe critical phenomena.  Tunneling processes are treated in detail, with applications to the lifetimes of supercurrents, the stability of metastable thermodynamic phases, and thelarge-order behavior of perturbation expansions. A variational treatment extends the range of validity to small barriers. A corresponding extension of the large-order perturbation theory now also applies to small orders.  Special attention is devoted to path integrals with topological restrictions needed to understand the statistical properties of elementary particles and the entanglement phenomena in polymer physics and biophysics. The ChernSimons theory of particles with fractional statistics (anyons) is introduced and applied to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect.  The relevance of path integrals to financial markets is discussed, and improvements of the famous BlackScholes formula for option prices are developed which account for the fact, recently experienced in the world markets, that large fluctuations occur much more frequently than in Gaussian distributions.","author":[{"family":"Kleinert","given":"Hagen"}],"citation-key":"kleinert2009","ISBN":"978-981-4273-55-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1626","publisher":"World Scientific","source":"Google Books","title":"Path Integrals in Quantum Mechanics, Statistics, Polymer Physics, and Financial Markets","type":"book"},

This activity has been as strong in the engineering and physical sciences as it has in mathematics, resulting inevitably in some duplication of effort due to an unfamiliarity with the developments in other disciplines. Much of the reported work has been motivated by the need to solve particular types of problems, for which, even more so than in the deterministic context, specific methods are required.

  {"id":"knill2008","abstract":"A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized π/2 pulse of 0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Knill","given":"E."},{"family":"Leibfried","given":"D."},{"family":"Reichle","given":"R."},{"family":"Britton","given":"J."},{"family":"Blakestad","given":"R.

Readers will learn about computational approaches for a range of challenges, including searching high-dimensional spaces, handling problems where there are multiple competing objectives, and accommodating uncertainty in the metrics. Figures, examples, and exercises convey the intuition behind the mathematical approaches. The text provides concrete implementations in the Julia programming language. Topics covered include derivatives and their generalization to multiple dimensions; local descent and first- and second-order methods that inform local descent; stochastic methods, which introduce randomness into the optimization process; linear constrained optimization, when both the objective function and the constraints are linear; surrogate models, probabilistic surrogate models, and using probabilistic surrogate models to guide optimization; optimization under uncertainty; uncertainty propagation; expression optimization; and multidisciplinary design optimization. Appendixes offer an introduction to the Julia language, test functions for evaluating algorithm performance, and mathematical concepts used in the derivation and analysis of the optimization methods discussed in the text.

That allows an analog to the classical picture of the phase space as the cotangent bundle. The mass-independent quantum geodesic equations as equations of free particle motion under a generic metric as a quantum observable are obtained from an invariant Hamiltonian.

Unlike traditional treatments, Cartan's geometry of fibre bundles and differential forms is placed at the forefront, and a detailed review of the relevant differential geometry is presented. Particular emphasis is given to general relativity in 4D space-time, in which the concepts of chirality and self-duality begin to play a key role. Associated chiral formulations are catalogued, and shown to lead to many practical simplifications. The book develops the chiral gravitational perturbation theory, in which the spinor formalism plays a central role. The book also presents in detail the twistor description of gravity, as well as its generalisation based on geometry of 3-forms in seven dimensions. Giving valuable insight into the very nature of gravity, this book joins our highly prestigious Cambridge Monographs in Mathematical Physics series.

If true, a consistent co-existence of classical gravity and quantum matter requires that gravity exhibit irreducible classical fluctuations. These fluctuations can mediate classical correlations between the quantized motion of the gravitationally interacting matter. We use a consistent theory of quantum-classical dynamics, together with general relativity, to show that experimentally relevant observables can conclusively test the hypothesis that gravity is classical. This can be done for example by letting highly coherent source masses interact with each other gravitationally, and performing precise measurements of the cross-correlation of their motion. Theory predicts a characteristic phase response that distinguishes classical gravity from quantum gravity, and from naive sources of decoherence.

  {"id":"kudrna2018","abstract":"An outstanding problem in open bosonic string field theory is the existence of nontrivial classical solutions in its universal sector. Such solutions independent of the underlying CFT would be relevant for any background, but aside of the celebrated tachyon vacuum, no well behaved solutions have been found so far. In this work we revisit the problem using the old fashioned level truncation technique, but armed with much more sophisticated techniques and greater computer power. In particular, using the homotopy continuation method we construct all solutions at level 6 (or 5) with twist symmetry imposed (or not), and improve the viable ones by Newton's method to levels 24-30. Surprisingly, a handful of solutions survive. One of them is tantalizingly close to the elusive double brane solution, although the fits to infinite level seem to invalidate this conclusion. A better behaved solution matches unexpectedly the properties of a ghost brane. This does not contradict anything, since the solution violates the reality condition of string field theory. Relaxing SU(1,1) singlet condition two more exotic solutions with the rough characteristics of half brane and ghost half brane are found. For the tachyon vacuum, by explicit numerical computations up to level 30, we confirm the Gaiotto and Rastelli's prediction about the turning point of the tachyon potential minimum as a function of the level.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kudrna","given":"Matej"},{"family":"Schnabl","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"kudrna2018","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1812.03221","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,7]]},"number":"arXiv:1812.03221","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Universal Solutions in Open String Field Theory","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03221"},

  {"id":"kumar2023","abstract":"We argue that the origin of unitarity violation and information loss paradox in our understanding of black holes (BH) lies in the standard way of doing quantum field theory in curved space-time (QFTCS), which is heavily biased on intuition borrowed from classical General Relativity. In this paper, with the quantum first approach, we formulate a so-called direct sum QFT (DQFT) in BH space-time based on a novel formulation of discrete space-time transformations in gravity that potentially restores unitarity. By invoking the quantum effects associated with the gravitational backreaction, we show that the Hawking quanta emerging outside of the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S=2GM$) cannot be independent of the quanta that continue to be inside $r_S$. This enables the information to be carried by Hawking quanta, but in the BH DQFT formalism, we do not get any firewalls. Furthermore, BH DQFT does not create any entanglement between interior and exterior Hawking quanta which implies there is no entanglement entropy and the BH evaporation happens involving only pure states. Finally, we discuss the ways our framework leaves important clues for formulating a scattering matrix and probing the nature of quantum gravity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"K.

The analysis is developed from the theory of linear constant coefficient systems via linear variable coefficient systems to general nonlinear systems. Further sections on control problems, generalized inverses of differential-algebraic operators, generalized solutions, and differential equations on manifolds complement the theoretical treatment of initial value problems. Two major classes of numerical methods for differential-algebraic equations (Runge-Kutta and BDF methods) are discussed and analyzed with respect to convergence and order. A chapter is devoted to index reduction methods that allow the numerical treatment of general differential-algebraic equations. The analysis and numerical solution of boundary value problems for differential-algebraic equations is presented, including multiple shooting and collocation methods. A survey of current software packages for differential-algebraic equations completes the text. The book is addressed to graduate students and researchers in mathematics, engineering and sciences, as well as practitioners in industry.

We propose a protocol that introduces reverse dynamics, in order to precisely control quantum systems against noise described by the Lindblad master equation. The reverse dynamics can be obtained by constructing the Petz recovery map in continuous time. By providing the exact form of the Hamiltonian and jump operators for the reverse dynamics, we explore the potential of utilizing the near-optimal recovery of the Petz map in controlling noisy quantum dynamics. While time-dependent dissipation engineering enables us to fully recover a single quantum trajectory, we also design a time-independent recovery protocol to protect encoded quantum information against decoherence. Our protocol can efficiently suppress only the noise part of dynamics thereby providing an effective unitary evolution of the quantum system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kwon","given":"Hyukjoon"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Rick"},{"family":"Kim","given":"M. S."}],"citation-key":"kwon2022","container-title":"Physical Review Letters","container-title-short":"Phys.

For each SPT phase, our algorithm runs a quantum circuit which emulates RG flow: an arbitrary input ground state wavefunction in the phase is mapped to a unique minimally-entangled reference state, thereby allowing for efficient phase identification. This construction is enabled by viewing a generic input state in the phase as a collection of coherent `errors' applied to the reference state, and engineering a quantum circuit to efficiently detect and correct such errors. Importantly, the error correction threshold is proven to coincide exactly with the phase boundary.

  {"id":"lamour2013","abstract":"Differential algebraic equations (DAEs), including so-called descriptor systems, began to attract significant research interest in applied and numerical mathematics in the early 1980s, no more than about three decades ago. In this relatively short time, DAEs have become a widely acknowledged tool to model processes subjected to constraints, in order to simulate and to control processes in various application fields such as network simulation, chemical kinematics, mechanical engineering, system biology.DAEs and their more abstract versions in infinite-dimensional spaces comprise a great potential for future mathematical modeling of complex coupled processes.The purpose of the book is to expose the impressive complexity of general DAEs from an analytical point of view, to describe the state of the art as well as open problems and so to motivate further research to this versatile, extra-ordinary topic from a broader mathematical perspective.The book elaborates a new general structural analysis capturing linear and nonlinear DAEs in a hierarchical way. The DAE structure is exposed by means of special projector functions. Numerical integration issues and computational aspects are treated also in this context.","author":[{"family":"Lamour","given":"René"},{"family":"März","given":"Roswitha"},{"family":"Tischendorf","given":"Caren"}],"citation-key":"lamour2013","ISBN":"978-3-642-27555-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,19]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"667","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Differential-Algebraic Equations: A Projector Based Analysis","title-short":"Differential-Algebraic Equations","type":"book"},
  {"id":"lan2023","abstract":"The essential singularity in Einstein's gravity can be avoidable if the preconditions of Penrose's theorem can be bypassed, i.e., if the strong energy condition is broken in the vicinity of a black hole center. The singularity mentioned here includes two aspects: (i) the divergence of curvature invariants, and (ii) the incompleteness of geodesics. The both aspects are now taken into account in order to determine whether a black hole contains essential singularities. In this sense, black holes without essential singularities are dubbed regular (non-singular) black holes. The regular black holes have some intriguing phenomena that are different from those of singular black holes, and such phenomena have inspired numerous studies. In this review, we summarize the current topics that are associated with regular black holes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Lan","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Miao","given":"Yan-Gang"}],"citation-key":"lan2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.11696","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.11696","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Regular black holes: A short topic review","title-short":"Regular black holes","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11696"},

The first version appeared in 1962, and was written at the very beginning of a period of great expansion of the subject. At the time, I found no satisfactory book for the foundations of the subject, for multiple reasons. I expanded the book in 1971, and I expand it still further today. Specifically, I have added three chapters on Riemannian and pseudo Riemannian geometry, that is, covariant derivatives, curvature, and some applications up to the Hopf-Rinow and Hadamard-Cartan theorems, as well as some calculus of variations and applications to volume forms. I have rewritten the sections on sprays, and I have given more examples of the use of Stokes' theorem. I have also given many more references to the literature, all of this to broaden the perspective of the book, which I hope can be used among things for a general course leading into many directions. The present book still meets the old needs, but fulfills new ones. At the most basic level, the book gives an introduction to the basic concepts which are used in differential topology, differential geometry, and differential equations.

In addition to updating all of the experimental and phenomenological results from the first edition, it contains a new chapter on collider physics; expanded discussions of Higgs, neutrino, and dark matter physics; and many new problems. The book first reviews calculational techniques in field theory and the status of quantum electrodynamics. It then focuses on global and local symmetries and the construction of non-abelian gauge theories. The structure and tests of quantum chromodynamics, collider physics, the electroweak interactions and theory, and the physics of neutrino mass and mixing are thoroughly explored. The final chapter discusses the motivations for extending the standard model and examines supersymmetry, extended gauge groups, and grand unification. Thoroughly covering gauge field theories, symmetries, and topics beyond the standard model, this text equips readers with the tools to understand the structure and phenomenological consequences of the standard model, to construct extensions, and to perform calculations at tree level.

  {"id":"larocca2022","abstract":"Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have received considerable attention due to their potential for achieving near-term quantum advantage. However, more work is needed to understand their scalability. One known scaling result for VQAs is barren plateaus, where certain circumstances lead to exponentially vanishing gradients. It is common folklore that problem-inspired ansatzes avoid barren plateaus, but in fact, very little is known about their gradient scaling. In this work we employ tools from quantum optimal control to develop a framework that can diagnose the presence or absence of barren plateaus for problem-inspired ansatzes. Such ansatzes include the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA), the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA), and others. With our framework, we prove that avoiding barren plateaus for these ansatzes is not always guaranteed. Specifically, we show that the gradient scaling of the VQA depends on the degree of controllability of the system, and hence can be diagnosed through the dynamical Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ obtained from the generators of the ansatz. We analyze the existence of barren plateaus in QAOA and HVA ansatzes, and we highlight the role of the input state, as different initial states can lead to the presence or absence of barren plateaus. Taken together, our results provide a framework for trainability-aware ansatz design strategies that do not come at the cost of extra quantum resources. Moreover, we prove no-go results for obtaining ground states with variational ansatzes for controllable system such as spin glasses. Our work establishes a link between the existence of barren plateaus and the scaling of the dimension of $\\mathfrak{g}$.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Larocca","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Czarnik","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Kunal"},{"family":"Muraleedharan","given":"Gopikrishnan"},{"family":"Coles","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Cerezo","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"larocca2022","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-09-29-824","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"page":"824","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Diagnosing Barren Plateaus with Tools from Quantum Optimal Control","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14377","volume":"6"},

In this paper, we derive the Newtonian limit of such classical-quantum (CQ) theories of gravity. Our results are obtained both via the gauge fixing of the recently proposed path integral theory of CQ general relativity and via the CQ master equation approach. In each case, we find the same weak field dynamics. We find that the Newtonian potential diffuses by an amount lower bounded by the decoherence rate into mass eigenstates. We also present our results as an unravelled system of stochastic differential equations for the trajectory of the hybrid classical-quantum state and provide a series of kernels for constructing figures of merit, which can be used to rule out part of the parameter space of classical-quantum theories of gravity by experimentally testing it via the decoherence-diffusion trade-off. We compare and contrast the weak field limit to previous models of classical Newtonian gravity coupled to quantum systems.

  {"id":"layton2023a","abstract":"We study the back-reaction of quantum systems onto classical ones. Taking the starting point that semi-classical physics should be described at all times by a point in classical phase space and a quantum state in Hilbert space, we consider an unravelling approach, describing the system in terms of a classical-quantum trajectory. We derive the general form of the dynamics under the assumptions that the classical trajectories are continuous and the evolution is autonomous, and the requirement that the dynamics is linear and completely positive in the combined classical-quantum state. This requirement is necessary in order to consistently describe probabilities, and forces the dynamics to be stochastic when the back-reaction is non-zero. The resulting equations of motion are natural generalisations of the standard semi-classical equations of motion, but since the resulting dynamics is linear in the combined classical-quantum state, it does not lead to the pathologies which usually follow from evolution laws based on expectation values. In particular, the evolution laws we present account for correlations between the classical and quantum system, which resolves issues associated with other semi-classical approaches. In addition, despite a breakdown of predictability in the classical degrees of freedom, the quantum state evolves deterministically conditioned on the classical trajectory, provided a trade-off between decoherence and diffusion is saturated. As a result, the quantum state remains pure when conditioned on the classical trajectory. To illustrate these points, we numerically simulate a number of semi-classical toy models, including one of vacuum fluctuations as a source driving the expansion of the universe. Finally, we discuss the application of these results to semi-classical gravity, and the black-hole information problem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Layton","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Oppenheim","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Weller-Davies","given":"Zachary"}],"citation-key":"layton2023a","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2208.11722","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,9]]},"number":"arXiv:2208.11722","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A healthier semi-classical dynamics","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11722"},
  {"id":"le2023","abstract":"Machine learning techniques are essential tools to compute efficient, yet accurate, force fields for atomistic simulations. This approach has recently been extended to incorporate quantum computational methods, making use of variational quantum learning models to predict potential energy surfaces and atomic forces from ab initio training data. However, the trainability and scalability of such models are still limited, due to both theoretical and practical barriers. Inspired by recent developments in geometric classical and quantum machine learning, here we design quantum neural networks that explicitly incorporate, as a data-inspired prior, an extensive set of physically relevant symmetries. We find that our invariant quantum learning models outperform their more generic counterparts on individual molecules of growing complexity. Furthermore, we study a water dimer as a minimal example of a system with multiple components, showcasing the versatility of our proposed approach and opening the way towards larger simulations. Our results suggest that molecular force fields generation can significantly profit from leveraging the framework of geometric quantum machine learning, and that chemical systems represent, in fact, an interesting and rich playground for the development and application of advanced quantum machine learning tools.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Le","given":"Isabel Nha Minh"},{"family":"Kiss","given":"Oriel"},{"family":"Schuhmacher","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Tavernelli","given":"Ivano"},{"family":"Tacchino","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"le2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2311.11362","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,19]]},"number":"arXiv:2311.11362","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Symmetry-invariant quantum machine learning force fields","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11362"},

Quantum mechanics conjectured a clue that final irreversibility is set by the measurement procedure and that the time-reversal requires complex conjugation of the wave function, which is overly complex to spontaneously appear in nature. Building on this Landau-Wigner conjecture, it became possible to demonstrate that time-reversal is exponentially improbable in a virgin nature and to design an algorithm artificially reversing a time arrow for a given quantum state on the IBM quantum computer. However, the implemented arrow-of-time reversal embraced only the known states initially disentangled from the thermodynamic reservoir. Here we develop a procedure for reversing the temporal evolution of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This opens the route for general universal algorithms sending temporal evolution of an arbitrary system backward in time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Lebedev","given":"A.

The question as to whether the laws of physics require these orientability assumptions is ultimately of observational or experimental nature, or the answer might come from a fundamental theory of physics. The possibility that spacetime is time non-orientable lacks investigation, and so should not be dismissed straightaway. In this paper, we argue that it is possible to locally access a putative time non-orientability of Minkowski empty spacetime by physical effects involving quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations. We set ourselves to study the influence of time non-orientability on the stochastic motions of a charged particle subject to these electromagnetic fluctuations in Minkowski spacetime equipped with a time non-orientable topology and with its time orientable counterpart. To this end, we introduce and derive analytic expressions for a statistical time orientability indicator.

Simulating a quantum computer entails implementing all of the unitary operators corresponding to the quantum gates as tensors. For high numbers of qubits, performing tensor multiplications for these simulations becomes quite expensive, since $N$-qubit gates correspond to $2^{N}$-dimensional tensors. One way to accelerate such a simulation is to use field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware to efficiently compute the matrix multiplications. Though FPGAs can efficiently perform tensor multiplications, they are memory bound, having relatively small block random access memory. One way to potentially reduce the memory footprint of a quantum computing system is to represent it as a tensor network; tensor networks are a formalism for representing compositions of tensors wherein economical tensor contractions are readily identified.

This method moves from one local minimizer of the objective function f to a better one at each iteration with the help of an auxiliary function termed the global descent function. The global descent function is not only guaranteed to have a local minimizer $x'$ over the problem domain in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ but also ensures that each of its local minimizers is located in some neighborhoods of a better minimizer of f with $f(x')<f(x^*)$. These features of the global descent function enable a global descent to be achieved at each iteration using only local descent methods. Computational experiments conducted on several test problems with up to 1000 variables demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, numerical comparison experiments carried out with GAMS/BARON on several test problems also justify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Levy","given":"A.

This approach is based on a parametrization stemming from Lie group theory through the exponential map. The parametrization transforms the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one over a Euclidean space, for which common first-order optimization methods can be used. The theoretical results presented are general enough to cover the special orthogonal group, the unitary group and, in general, any connected compact Lie group. We discuss how this and other parametrizations can be computed efficiently through an implementation trick, making numerically complex parametrizations usable at a negligible runtime cost in neural networks. In particular, we apply our results to RNNs with orthogonal recurrent weights, yielding a new architecture called expRNN. We demonstrate how our method constitutes a more robust approach to optimization with orthogonal constraints, showing faster, accurate, and more stable convergence in several tasks designed to test RNNs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lezcano-Casado","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Martı́nez-Rubio","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"lezcano-casado2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning","event-title":"International Conference on Machine Learning","ISSN":"2640-3498","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"3794-3803","publisher":"PMLR","source":"proceedings.mlr.press","title":"Cheap Orthogonal Constraints in Neural Networks: A Simple Parametrization of the Orthogonal and Unitary Group","title-short":"Cheap Orthogonal Constraints in Neural Networks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/lezcano-casado19a.html"},

Most generally, the evolution of an open quantum system is described by a completely positive linear map. We show how to derive a completely positive Markovian master equation (the Lindblad equation) from such a map by a coarse graining procedure. We provide a novel and explicit recipe for calculating the coefficients of the master equation, using perturbation theory in the weak-coupling limit. The only parameter external to our theory is the coarse-graining time-scale. We illustrate the method by explicitly deriving the master equation for the spin-boson model. The results are evaluated for the exactly solvable case of pure dephasing, and an excellent agreement is found within the timescale where the Markovian approximation is expected to be valid.

Despite recent interest in the emergent gravity program within the physics as well as the philosophy community, an assessment of the general motivation for this idea is lacking at the moment. We intend to fill this gap in the literature by discussing the main arguments in favour of the hypothesis that the metric field and its dynamics are emergent. First, we distinguish between microstructure inspired from GR, such as through quantization or discretization, and microstructure that is not directly motivated from GR, such as strings, quantum bits or condensed matter fields. The emergent gravity approach can then be defined as the view that the metric field and its dynamics are derivable from the latter type of microstructure. Subsequently, we assess in how far the following properties of (semi-classical) GR are suggestive of underlying microstructure: (1) the metric's universal coupling to matter fields, (2) perturbative non-renormalizability, (3) black hole thermodynamics, and (4) the holographic principle. In the conclusion we formalize the general structure of the plausibility arguments put forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Linnemann","given":"Niels S."},{"family":"Visser","given":"Manus R."}],"citation-key":"linnemann2018","container-title":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsb.2018.04.001","ISSN":"1355-2198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Hints towards the emergent nature of gravity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219817302046","volume":"64"},

Nevertheless one may wonder if it would be possible to attribute a meaningful notion of temperature to an arbitrary quantum state, beyond simply the thermal (Gibbs) state. In this work, we propose such a notion of temperature considering an operational task, inspired by the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we define two effective temperatures for quantifying the ability of a quantum system to cool down or heat up a thermal environment. In this way we can associate an operationally meaningful notion of temperature to any quantum density matrix. We provide general expressions for these effective temperatures, for both single- and many-copy systems, establishing connections to concepts previously discussed in the literature. Finally, we consider a more sophisticated scenario where the heat exchange between the system and the thermal environment is assisted by a quantum reference frame.

  {"id":"ludwig2012","abstract":"In the first volume we based quantum mechanics on the objective description of macroscopic devices. The further development of the quantum mechanics of atoms, molecules, and collision processes has been described in [2]. In this context also the usual description of composite systems by tensor products of Hilbert spaces has been introduced. This method can be formally extrapolated to systems composed of \"many\" ele mentary systems, even arbitrarily many. One formerly had the opinion that this \"extrapolated quantum mechanics\" is a more comprehensive theory than the objec tive description of macrosystems, an opinion which generated unsurmountable diffi culties for explaining the measuring process. With respect to our foundation of quan tum mechanics on macroscopic objectivity, this opinion would mean that our founda tion is no foundation at all. The task of this second volume is to attain a compatibility between the objective description of macrosystems and an extrapolated quantum mechanics. Thus in X we establish the \"statistical mechanics\" of macrosystems as a theory more compre hensive than an extrapolated quantum mechanics. On this basis we solve the problem of the measuring process in quantum mechan ics, in XI developing a theory which describes the measuring process as an interaction between microsystems and a macroscopic device. This theory also allows to calculate \"in principle\" the observable measured by a device. Neither an incorporation of consciousness nor a mysterious imagination such as \"collapsing\" wave packets are necessary.","author":[{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Günther"}],"citation-key":"ludwig2012","ISBN":"978-3-642-71897-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,6]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"252","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"An Axiomatic Basis for Quantum Mechanics: Volume 2 Quantum Mechanics and Macrosystems","title-short":"An Axiomatic Basis for Quantum Mechanics","type":"book"},

This general description is a basis for the special de scription of devices consisting of two parts, where the first part is acting on the second. The microsystems are discovered as systems transmitting the action. Axioms which describe general empirical structures of the interactions between the two parts of each device, give rise to a derivation of the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics.

  {"id":"lukens2021","abstract":"The method of classical shadows proposed by Huang, Kueng, and Preskill heralds remarkable opportunities for quantum estimation with limited measurements. Yet its relationship to established quantum tomographic approaches, particularly those based on likelihood models, remains unclear. In this article, we investigate classical shadows through the lens of Bayesian mean estimation (BME). In direct tests on numerical data, BME is found to attain significantly lower error on average, but classical shadows prove remarkably more accurate in specific situations—such as high-fidelity ground truth states—which are improbable in a fully uniform Hilbert space. We then introduce an observable-oriented pseudo-likelihood that successfully emulates the dimension-independence and state-specific optimality of classical shadows, but within a Bayesian framework that ensures only physical states. Our research reveals how classical shadows effect important departures from conventional thinking in quantum state estimation, as well as the utility of Bayesian methods for uncovering and formalizing statistical assumptions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Lukens","given":"Joseph M."},{"family":"Law","given":"Kody J.

  {"id":"lusztig2010","abstract":"According to Drinfeld, a quantum group is the same as a Hopf algebra. This includes as special cases, the algebra of regular functions on an algebraic group and the enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra. The qu- tum groups discussed in this book are the quantized enveloping algebras introduced by Drinfeld and Jimbo in 1985, or variations thereof. Although such quantum groups appeared in connection with problems in statistical mechanics and are closely related to conformal field theory and knot theory, we will regard them purely as a new development in Lie theory. Their place in Lie theory is as follows. Among Lie groups and Lie algebras (whose theory was initiated by Lie more than a hundred years ago) the most important and interesting ones are the semisimple ones. They were classified by E. Cartan and Killing around 1890 and are quite central in today's mathematics. The work of Chevalley in the 1950s showed that semisimple groups can be defined over arbitrary fields (including finite ones) and even over integers. Although semisimple Lie algebras cannot be deformed in a non-trivial way, the work of Drinfeld and Jimbo showed that their enveloping (Hopf) algebras admit a rather interesting deformation depending on a parameter v. These are the quantized enveloping algebras of Drinfeld and Jimbo.

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way.

Exploring the symmetry of the most fundamental two body system has led to advances in atomic physics, quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and elementary particle physics. In this pedagogic review we present an integrated treatment of the symmetries of the Schrodinger hydrogen atom, including the classical atom, the SO(4) degeneracy group, the non-invariance group or spectrum generating group SO(4,1) and the expanded group SO(4,2). After giving a brief history of these discoveries, most of which took place from 1935-1975, we focus on the physics of the hydrogen atom, providing a background discussion of the symmetries, providing explicit expressions for all the manifestly Hermitian generators in terms of position and momenta operators in a Cartesian space, explaining the action of the generators on the basis states, and giving a unified treatment of the bound and continuum states in terms of eigenfunctions that have the same quantum numbers as the ordinary bound states. We present some new results from SO(4,2) group theory that are useful in a practical application, the computation of the first order Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom. By using SO(4,2) methods, we are able to obtain a generating function for the radiative shift for all levels.

No photonic machine offering programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation, lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and photon-number-resolving architecture. On average, it would take more than 9,000 years for the best available algorithms and supercomputers to produce, using exact methods, a single sample from the programmed distribution, whereas Borealis requires only 36 μs. This runtime advantage is over 50 million times as extreme as that reported from earlier photonic machines.

  {"id":"mahadev2018","abstract":"We present the first protocol allowing a classical computer to interactively verify the result of an efficient quantum computation. We achieve this by constructing a measurement protocol, which enables a classical verifier to use a quantum prover as a trusted measurement device. The protocol forces the prover to behave as follows: the prover must construct an n qubit state of his choice, measure each qubit in the Hadamard or standard basis as directed by the verifier, and report the measurement results to the verifier. The soundness of this protocol is enforced based on the assumption that the learning with errors problem is computationally intractable for efficient quantum machines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Mahadev","given":"Urmila"}],"citation-key":"mahadev2018","container-title":"arXiv:1804.01082 [quant-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,12]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Classical Verification of Quantum Computations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01082"},

Students want to learn new material, and textbooks must be modified to keep up with the times. The early chapters in this book teach the techniques of many-body theory. They are largely unchanged in format. The later chapters apply the techniques to specific problems. The third edition increases the number of applications. New sections have been added, while old sections have been modified to include recent applications. The previous editions were set in type using pre-computer technology. No computer file existed of the prior editions. The publisher scanned the second edition and gave me a disk with the contents.

The model consists of N Majorana fermions with random interactions of a few fermions at a time. It it tractable in the large-N limit, where the classical variable is a bilocal fermion bilinear. The model becomes strongly interacting at low energies where it develops an emergent conformal symmetry. We study two- and four-point functions of the fundamental fermions. This provides the spectrum of physical excitations for the bilocal field. The emergent conformal symmetry is a reparametrization symmetry, which is spontaneously broken to SL(2,R), leading to zero modes. These zero modes are lifted by a small residual explicit breaking, which produces an enhanced contribution to the four-point function. This contribution displays a maximal Lyapunov exponent in the chaos region (out-of-time-ordered correlator). We expect these features to be universal properties of large-N quantum mechanics systems with emergent reparametrization symmetry.

We discuss some applications to the cloning paradox for old black holes. We point out that the same formula we derived for gravity is also valid for the simple SYK quantum mechanical theory, around the thermofield double state.

Any attempt to resolve this long-standing problem seems to be doomed, as the route to any direct empirical evidence (i.e., detecting gravitons) for shedding light on the quantum aspect of the gravity is far beyond the current capabilities. Recently, it has been discovered that gravitationally-induced entanglement, tailored in the interferometric frameworks, can be used to witness the quantum nature of the gravity. Even though these schemes offer promising tools for investigating quantum gravity, many fundamental and empirical aspects of the schemes are yet to be discovered. Considering the fact that, beside quantum entanglement, quantum uncertainty and complementarity principles are the two other foundational aspects of quantum physics, the quantum nature of the gravity needs to manifest all of these features. Here, we lay out an interferometric platform for testing these three nonclassical aspects of quantum mechanics in quantum gravity setting, which connects gravity and quantum physics in a broader and deeper context. As we show in this work, all of these three fundamental features of quantum gravity can be framed and fully analyzed in an interferometric scheme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Maleki","given":"Yusef"},{"family":"Maleki","given":"Alireza"}],"citation-key":"maleki2022","container-title":"arXiv:2205.01967 [gr-qc, physics:hep-th, physics:quant-ph]","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevD.105.086024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Complementarity-Entanglement Tradeoff in Quantum Gravity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01967"},

The treatment, which has its origin in Purcell's explanation of the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, is shown to apply to any quasi-monochromatic light, whether stationary or not, and whether of thermal origin or not. The representation of the classical wave amplitude, of the light by Gabor's complex analytic signal appears naturally in this treatment. It is shown that the correlation of counts registered by N separate photodetectors at N points in space is determined by a 2Nth order correlation function of the complex classical field. The variance of the individual counts is shown to be expressible as the sum of terms representing the effects of classical particles and classical waves, in analogy to a well-known result of Einstein relating to black-body radiation. Since the theory applies to correlation effects obtained with any type of light it applies, in particular, to the output of an optical maser, although, for a maser operating on one mode, correlation effects are likely to be very small.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Mandel","given":"L."},{"family":"Sudarshan","given":"E.

The diversity of these applications indicates the flexibility and unifying character of the presented framework. While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular application, we single out a frequently applicable construction method for pattern statistics: We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA from a given DAA and a finite-memory random text model. We show how to transform a finite automaton into a DAA and then into the corresponding PAA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Marschall","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Herms","given":"Inke"},{"family":"Kaltenbach","given":"Hans-Michael"},{"family":"Rahmann","given":"Sven"}],"citation-key":"marschall2010","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",11,26]]},"number":"arXiv:1011.5778","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Probabilistic Arithmetic Automata and their Applications","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5778"},

  {"id":"martyn2021","abstract":"Quantum algorithms offer significant speed-ups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms have recently been tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW’19 paper on the QSVT [Gilyén et al., ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which the QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW’19, we then employ the QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how the QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Martyn","given":"John M."},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Zane M."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Andrew K."},{"family":"Chuang","given":"Isaac L."}],"citation-key":"martyn2021","container-title":"PRX Quantum","container-title-short":"PRX Quantum","DOI":"10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,3]]},"page":"040203","publisher":"American Physical Society","source":"APS","title":"Grand Unification of Quantum Algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040203","volume":"2"},

The book brings a major paradigm shift to medical sciences exploring the use of fuzzy sets in epidemiology and medical diagnosis arena. The volume addresses the most significant topics in the broad areas of epidemiology, mathematical modeling and uncertainty, embodying them within the framework of fuzzy set and dynamic systems theory.  Written by leading contributors to the area of epidemiology, medical informatics and mathematics, the book combines a very lucid and authoritative exposition of the fundamentals of fuzzy sets with an insightful use of the fundamentals in the area of epidemiology and diagnosis. The content is clearly illustrated by numerous illustrative examples and several real world applications. Based on their profound knowledge of epidemiology and mathematical modeling, and on their keen understanding of the role played by uncertainty and fuzzy sets, the authors provide insights into the connections between biological phenomena and dynamic systems as a mean to predict, diagnose, and prescribe actions. An example is the use of Bellman-Zadeh fuzzy decision making approach to develop a vaccination strategy to manage measles epidemics in São Paulo. The book offers a comprehensive, systematic, fully updated and self- contained treatise of fuzzy sets in epidemiology and diagnosis. Its content covers material of vital interest to students, researchers and practitioners and is suitable both as a textbook and as a reference.

In our proposed approach, the search by a Fleming-Viot particle is stopped when it encounters a region where the gradient is too small or noisy. The stopped particle continues the search after being regenerated at another potentially more interesting location of the parameter space, biasing the exploration away from barren plateaus. We analyze the behavior of the Fleming-Viot particles from a theoretical standpoint, backed up with numerical experiments on synthetic problems as well as on selected instances of the Max-Cut problem on graphs, which show that our method performs better than plain-vanilla variants when there are large barren plateaus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mastropietro","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Korpas","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Kungurtsev","given":"Vyacheslav"},{"family":"Marecek","given":"Jakub"}],"citation-key":"mastropietroFlemingViotHelpsSpeed2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2311.18090","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2311.18090","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Fleming-Viot helps speed up variational quantum algorithms in the presence of barren plateaus","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18090"},
  {"id":"masui2024","abstract":"It is a challenging problem to correctly characterize the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. As the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) utilizes non-trivial edge states of the SPT phases as the logical qubit, its computational power is closely tied to the non-trivial topological nature of the phases. In this paper, we propose to use the gate fidelity which is a measure of the computational power of the MBQC to identify the SPT phases in mixed-state settings. Specifically, we investigate the robustness of the Haldane phase by considering the MBQC on the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state subject to different types of noises. To illustrate how our criterion works, we analytically and numerically calculated the gate fidelity to find that its behavior depends crucially on whether the noises satisfy a certain symmetry condition with respect to the on-site $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. In particular, the fidelity for the identity gate, which is given by the sum of the non-local string order parameters, plays an important role. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a stronger symmetry conditions are required to be able to perform other (e.g., the $Z$-rotation gate) gates with high fidelity. By examining which unitary gates can be implemented with the MBQC on the decohered states, we can gain a useful insight into the richer structure of noisy SPT states that cannot be captured solely by the string order parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Masui","given":"Riku"},{"family":"Totsuka","given":"Keisuke"}],"citation-key":"masui2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2405.18364","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.18364","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Computational Characterization of Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18364"},

It is intended primarily as a &quot;self-study&quot; book that introduces one aspect of many-body theory, i.e. the method of Feynman diagrams. The book also lends itself to use as a reference in courses on solid state and nuclear physics which make some use of the many-body techniques. And, finally, it can be used as a supplementary reference in a many-body course.Chapters 1 through 6 provide an introduction to the major concepts of the field, among them Feynman diagrams, quasi-particles and vacuum amplitudes. Chapters 7 through 16 give basic coverage to topics ranging from Dyson&#39;s equation and the ladder approximation to Fermi systems at finite temperature and superconductivity. Appendixes summarize the Dirac formalism and include a rigorous derivation of the rules for diagrams. Problems are provided at the end of each chapter and solutions are given at the back of the book.For this second edition, Dr. Mattuck, formerly of the H. C.

We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits.

We explain how to perform universal computation with logical qubits and logical MZMs while using far fewer resources than in other MSC schemes. All Clifford gates can be implemented on logical qubits by braiding twist defects. We introduce measurement-based techniques for computing with logical MZMs and logical qubits, achieving the effect of Clifford gates with zero time overhead. We also show that logical MZMs result in an improved scaling of spatial overheads with respect to code distance for all steps of the computation.

For universal quantum computation, a nonlinear element is required. This can be satisfied by adding to the toolbox any single-mode non-Gaussian measurement, while the initial cluster state itself remains Gaussian. Homodyne detection alone suffices to perform an arbitrary multimode Gaussian transformation via the cluster state. We also propose an experiment to demonstrate cluster-based error reduction when implementing Gaussian operations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Menicucci","given":"Nicolas C."},{"family":"Loock","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Mile"},{"family":"Weedbrook","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Ralph","given":"Timothy C."},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Michael A."}],"citation-key":"menicucci2006","container-title":"Physical Review Letters","container-title-short":"Phys.

We then use this graphical calculus to analyze continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, the essential resource for one-way quantum computing with CV systems. Current graphical approaches to CV cluster states are only valid in the unphysical limit of infinite squeezing, and the associated graph transformation rules only apply when the initial and final states are of this form. Our formalism applies to all Gaussian pure states and subsumes these rules in a natural way. In addition, the term “CV graph state” currently has several inequivalent definitions in use. Using this formalism we provide a single unifying definition that encompasses all of them. We provide many examples of how the formalism may be used in the context of CV cluster states: defining the “closest” CV cluster state to a given Gaussian pure state and quantifying the error in the approximation due to finite squeezing; analyzing the optimality of certain methods of generating CV cluster states; drawing connections between this graphical formalism and bosonic Hamiltonians with Gaussian ground states, including those useful for CV one-way quantum computing; and deriving a graphical measure of bipartite entanglement for certain classes of CV cluster states. We mention other possible applications of this formalism and conclude with a brief note on fault tolerance in CV one-way quantum computing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Menicucci","given":"Nicolas C."},{"family":"Flammia","given":"Steven T."},{"family":"Loock","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"menicucci2011","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

We show that the standard approach of process tomography is grossly inaccurate in the case where the states and measurement operators used to interrogate the system are generated by gates that have some systematic error, a situation all but unavoidable in any practical setting. These errors in tomography cannot be fully corrected through oversampling or by performing a larger set of experiments. We present an alternative method for tomography to reconstruct an entire library of gates in a self-consistent manner. The essential ingredient is to define a likelihood function that assumes nothing about the gates used for preparation and measurement. In order to make the resulting optimization tractable, we linearize about the target, a reasonable approximation when benchmarking a quantum computer as opposed to probing a black-box function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Merkel","given":"Seth T."},{"family":"Gambetta","given":"Jay M."},{"family":"Smolin","given":"John A."},{"family":"Poletto","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Córcoles","given":"Antonio D."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Blake R."},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Colm A."},{"family":"Steffen","given":"Matthias"}],"citation-key":"merkel2013","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

These soft constraints are often considered to be the sources of the complexity in the training phase of PINNs. Here, we demonstrate that the challenge of training (i) persists even when the boundary conditions are strictly enforced, and (ii) is closely related to the Kolmogorov n-width associated with problems demonstrating transport, convection, traveling waves, or moving fronts. Given this realization, we describe the mechanism underlying the training schemes such as those used in eXtended PINNs (XPINN), curriculum regularization, and sequence-to-sequence learning. For an important category of PDEs, i.e., governed by non-linear convection-diffusion equation, we propose reformulating PINNs on a Lagrangian frame of reference, i.e., LPINNs, as a PDE-informed solution. A parallel architecture with two branches is proposed. One branch solves for the state variables on the characteristics, and the second branch solves for the low-dimensional characteristics curves. The proposed architecture conforms to the causality innate to the convection, and leverages the direction of travel of the information in the domain. Finally, we demonstrate that the loss landscapes of LPINNs are less sensitive to the so-called \"complexity\" of the problems, compared to those in the traditional PINNs in the Eulerian framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mojgani","given":"Rambod"},{"family":"Balajewicz","given":"Maciej"},{"family":"Hassanzadeh","given":"Pedram"}],"citation-key":"mojgani2023","container-title":"Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","container-title-short":"Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","DOI":"10.1016/j.cma.2022.115810","ISSN":"00457825","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"page":"115810","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Lagrangian PINNs: A causality-conforming solution to failure modes of physics-informed neural networks","title-short":"Lagrangian PINNs","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02902","volume":"404"},

The stabilizer formalism and the Gottesman-Knill theorem, where pure stabilizer or graph states are manipulated by Clifford operations and Pauli measurements, are prominent examples, and these states play a major role in many applications in quantum technologies. Here we develop a noisy stabilizer formalism, i.e., a method that allows one not only to efficiently describe and follow pure states under Clifford operations and Pauli measurements but also Pauli noise processes acting on such stabilizer states, including uncorrelated and correlated dephasing and single- or multi-qubit depolarizing noise. The method scales linearly in the number of qubits of the initial state, but exponentially in the size of the target state. Thus, whenever a noisy stabilizer state is manipulated by means of local Pauli measurements such that a multipartite entangled state of a few qubits is generated, one can efficiently describe the resulting state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mor-Ruiz","given":"Maria Flors"},{"family":"Dür","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"mor-ruiz2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2212.08677","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,16]]},"number":"arXiv:2212.08677","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Noisy Stabilizer Formalism","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08677"},

Condensed matter physics deals with a wide variety of topics, ranging from gas to liquids and solids, as well as plasma, where owing to the inter play between the motions of a tremendous number of electrons and nuclei, rich varieties of physical phenomena occur. Quantum field theory is the most appropriate \"language\", to describe systems with such a large number of de grees of freedom, and therefore its importance for condensed matter physics is obvious. Indeed, up to now, quantum field theory has been succesfully ap plied to many different topics in condensed matter physics. Recently, quan tum field theory has become more and more important in research on the electronic properties of condensed systems, which is the main topic of the present volume. Up to now, the motion of electrons in solids has been successfully de scribed by focusing on one electron and replacing the Coulomb interaction of all the other electrons by a mean field potential. This method is called mean field theory, which made important contributions to the explanantion of the electronic structure in solids, and led to the classification of insulators, semiconductors and metals in terms of the band theory. It might be said that also the present achievements in the field of semiconductor technology rely on these foundations. In the mean field approximation, effects that arise due to the correlation of the motions of many particles, cannot be described.","author":[{"family":"Nagaosa","given":"Naoto"}],"citation-key":"nagaosa2013","ISBN":"978-3-662-03774-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,11]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"213","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Quantum Field Theory in Condensed Matter Physics","type":"book"},

Attention has been focused on the norms of behavior of learning automata, issues in the design of updating schemes, convergence of the action probabilities, and interaction of several automata. Utilization of learning automata in parameter optimization and hypothesis testing is discussed, and potential areas of application are suggested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Narendra","given":"Kumpati S."},{"family":"Thathachar","given":"M.

In order to simplify the implementation, we leveraged modern machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. Besides, offering implementation of basic models (such as multilayer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks) and optimization methods, these frameworks offer powerful automatic differentiation. With all that, the main advantage of our approach is that one can implement hybrid models combining physics-informed and data-driven kernels, where data-driven kernels are used to reduce the gap between predictions and observations. Alternatively, we can also perform model parameter identification. In order to illustrate our approach, we used two case studies. The first one consisted of performing fatigue crack growth integration through Euler’s forward method using a hybrid model combining a data-driven stress intensity range model with a physics-based crack length increment model. The second case study consisted of performing model parameter identification of a dynamic two-degree-of-freedom system through Runge–Kutta integration.

  {"id":"nayak2008a","abstract":"Topological quantum computation has recently emerged as one of the most exciting approaches to constructing a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The proposal relies on the existence of topological states of matter whose quasiparticle excitations are neither bosons nor fermions, but are particles known as {\\it Non-Abelian anyons}, meaning that they obey {\\it non-Abelian braiding statistics}. Quantum information is stored in states with multiple quasiparticles, which have a topological degeneracy. The unitary gate operations which are necessary for quantum computation are carried out by braiding quasiparticles, and then measuring the multi-quasiparticle states. The fault-tolerance of a topological quantum computer arises from the non-local encoding of the states of the quasiparticles, which makes them immune to errors caused by local perturbations. To date, the only such topological states thought to have been found in nature are fractional quantum Hall states, most prominently the \\nu=5/2 state, although several other prospective candidates have been proposed in systems as disparate as ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and thin film superconductors. In this review article, we describe current research in this field, focusing on the general theoretical concepts of non-Abelian statistics as it relates to topological quantum computation, on understanding non-Abelian quantum Hall states, on proposed experiments to detect non-Abelian anyons, and on proposed architectures for a topological quantum computer. We address both the mathematical underpinnings of topological quantum computation and the physics of the subject using the \\nu=5/2 fractional quantum Hall state as the archetype of a non-Abelian topological state enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nayak","given":"Chetan"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Steven H."},{"family":"Stern","given":"Ady"},{"family":"Freedman","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sarma","given":"Sankar Das"}],"citation-key":"nayak2008a","container-title":"Reviews of Modern Physics","container-title-short":"Rev.

The localized functions belong to a continuous spectrum of an operator which it is natural to call the position operator. This operator has automatically the property of preserving the positive energy character of the wave function to which it is applied (and it should be applied only to such wave functions).

In particular, many emerging quantum architectures are designed to achieve high coherence at the expense of having fixed spectra and consequently limited types of controllable interactions. Here, by adiabatically transforming fixed-frequency superconducting circuits into modifiable Floquet qubits, we demonstrate an XXZ Heisenberg interaction with fully adjustable anisotropy. This interaction model is on one hand the basis for many-body quantum simulation of spin systems, and on the other hand the primitive for an expressive quantum gate set. To illustrate the robustness and versatility of our Floquet protocol, we tailor the Heisenberg Hamiltonian and implement two-qubit iSWAP, CZ, and SWAP gates with estimated fidelities of 99.32(3)%, 99.72(2)%, and 98.93(5)%, respectively. In addition, we implement a Heisenberg interaction between higher energy levels and employ it to construct a three-qubit CCZ gate with a fidelity of 96.18(5)%. Importantly, the protocol is applicable to various fixed-frequency high-coherence platforms, thereby unlocking a suite of essential interactions for high-performance quantum information processing.

When trained only on true samples, the FNO correctly predicts (unique or ambiguous) phases of amplitudes with infinite partial wave expansions. When also trained on false samples, it can rate the quality of its prediction by producing a true/false classifying index. We observe that the value of this index is strongly correlated with the violation of the unitarity constraint for the predicted phase, and present examples where it delineates the boundary between allowed and disallowed profiles of the modulus.

In the classical case, the conditional expectations always exist; in the quantum case, however, they exist only if a certain weak compatibility criterion is satisfied. This compatibility criterion was introduced among others in a recent paper by the author. Then, state-independent conditional expectations and quantum Markov processes are studied. A classical Markov process is a probability measure, together with a system of random variables, satisfying the Markov property and can equivalently be described by a system of Markovian kernels (often forming a semigroup). This equivalence is partly extended to quantum probabilities. It is shown that a dynamical (semi)group can be derived from a given system of quantum observables satisfying the Markov property, and the group generators are studied. The results are presented in the framework of Jordan operator algebras, and a very general type of observables (including the usual real-valued observables or self-adjoint operators) is considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Niestegge","given":"Gerd"}],"citation-key":"niestegge2005","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.1861275","ISSN":"0022-2488, 1089-7658","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",4,1]]},"page":"043507","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Conditional expectations associated with quantum states","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3828","volume":"46"},

Because of the wide (and growing) use of optimization in science, engineering, economics, and industry, it is essential for students and practitioners alike to develop an understanding of optimization algorithms. Knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of these algorithms leads to a better understanding of their impact on various applications, and points the way to future research on improving and extending optimization algorithms and software. Our goal in this book is to give a comprehensive description of the most powerful, state-of-the-art, techniques for solving continuous optimization problems. By presenting the motivating ideas for each algorithm, we try to stimulate the reader’s intuition and make the technical details easier to follow. Formal mathematical requirements are kept to a minimum.

  {"id":"ohanesjan2022","abstract":"The dynamics when a hot many-body quantum system is brought into instantaneous contact with a cold many-body quantum system can be understood as a combination of early time quantum correlation (von Neumann entropy) gain and late time energy relaxation. We show that at the shortest timescales there is an energy increase in each system linked to the entropy gain, even though equilibrium thermodynamics does not apply. This energy increase is of quantum origin and results from the collective binding energy between the two systems. Counter-intuitively, this implies that also the hotter of the two systems generically experiences an initial energy increase when brought into contact with the other colder system. In the limit where the energy relaxation overwhelms the (quantum) correlation build-up, classical energy dynamics emerges where the energy in the hot system decreases immediately upon contact with a cooler system.

As a first example, we will see how a Stochastic Schr\\\"odinger Equation, when used to compute the reduced density matrix of a non-Markovian open quantum system, necessarily seems to employ the Bohmian concept of a conditional wavefunction. We will see that by dressing these conditional wavefunctions with an interpretation, the Bohmian theory can prove to be a useful tool to build general quantum frameworks, like a high-frequency electron transport model. As a second example, we will introduce how a Copenhagen \"observable operator\" can be derived from numerical properties of the Bohmian trajectories, which within Bohmian mechanics, are well-defined even for an \"unmeasured\" system. Most importantly in practice, even if these numbers are given no ontological meaning, not only we will be able to simulate (thus, predict and talk about) them, but we will see that they can be operationally determined in a weak value experiment.

  {"id":"okamura2016","abstract":"In this paper, we aim to establish foundations of measurement theory in local quantum physics. For this purpose, we discuss a representation theory of completely positive (CP) instruments on arbitrary von Neumann algebras. We introduce a condition called the normal extension property (NEP) and establish a one-to-one correspondence between CP instruments with the NEP and statistical equivalence classes of measuring processes. We show that every CP instrument on an atomic von Neumann algebra has the NEP, extending the well-known result for type I factors. Moreover, we show that every CP instrument on an injective von Neumann algebra is approximated by CP instruments with the NEP. The concept of posterior states is also discussed to show that the NEP is equivalent to the existence of a strongly measurable family of posterior states for every normal state. Two examples of CP instruments without the NEP are obtained from this result. It is thus concluded that in local quantum physics not every CP instrument represents a measuring process, but in most of physically relevant cases every CP instrument can be realized by a measuring process within arbitrary error limits, as every approximately finite dimensional (AFD) von Neumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is injective. To conclude the paper, the concept of local measurement in algebraic quantum field theory is examined in our framework. In the setting of the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts and Doplicher-Roberts (DHR-DR) theory describing local excitations, we show that an instrument on a local algebra can be extended to a local instrument on the global algebra if and only if it is a CP instrument with the NEP, provided that the split property holds for the net of local algebras.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Okamura","given":"Kazuya"},{"family":"Ozawa","given":"Masanao"}],"citation-key":"okamura2016","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.4935407","ISSN":"0022-2488, 1089-7658","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,1]]},"page":"015209","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Measurement theory in local quantum physics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00239","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"ona2023","abstract":"The question about the appearance of time in the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity continues to be discussed in the literature. It is believed that a temporal Schrodinger equation for matter fields on the background of a classical gravitational field must be true. To obtain this equation, the Born - Oppenheimer approximation for gravity is used. However, the origin of time in this equation is different in works of various authors. For example, in the papers of Kiefer and his collaborators, time is a parameter along a classical trajectory of gravitational field; in the works of Montani and his collaborators the origin of time is introducing the Kuchar - Torre reference fluid; in the extended phase space approach the origin of time is the consequence of existing of the observer in a fixed reference frame. We discuss and compare these approaches. To make the calculations transparent, we illustrate them with a model of a closed isotropic universe. In each approach, one obtains some Schrodinger equation for matter fields with quantum gravitational corrections, but the form of the equation and the corrections depend on additional assumptions which are rather arbitrary. None of the approaches can explain how time had appeared in the Early Universe, since it is supposed that classical gravity and, therefore, classical spacetime had already come into being.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Oña","given":"R.

Consistent dynamics of this coupling has been shown to exist, and explored in the context of treating space-time classically. Here, we prove that such hybrid dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of the quantum system, and a breakdown in predictability in the classical phase space. We further prove that a trade-off between the rate of this decoherence and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general feature of all classical quantum dynamics; long coherence times require strong diffusion in phase-space relative to the strength of the coupling. Applying the trade-off relation to gravity, we find a relationship between the strength of gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric and its conjugate momenta. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical theory of gravity interacts with quantum matter.

As a result, the ``measurement postulate'' of quantum theory is not needed; quantum systems become classical because they interact with a fundamentally classical field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Oppenheim","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Sparaciari","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Šoda","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Weller-Davies","given":"Zachary"}],"citation-key":"oppenheim2023b","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2023-01-03-891","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,3]]},"page":"891","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Objective trajectories in hybrid classical-quantum dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06009","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"oppenheim2024","abstract":"We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this \"diffusion regime\", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute how this modifies the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find that an entropic force driven by a stochastic cosmological constant can explain galactic rotation curves without needing to evoke dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Oppenheim","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"oppenheim2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2402.19459","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459"},
  {"id":"oppenheimPostquantumTheoryClassical2021","abstract":"We present a consistent theory of classical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. The dynamics is linear in the density matrix, completely positive and trace-preserving, and reduces to Einstein's theory of general relativity in the classical limit. As a result, the dynamics doesn't suffer from the pathologies of the semi-classical theory based on expectation values. The assumption that general relativity is classical necessarily modifies the dynamical laws of quantum mechanics -- the theory must be fundamentally stochastic in both the metric degrees of freedom and in the quantum matter fields. This allows it to evade several no-go theorems purporting to forbid classical-quantum interactions. The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics is not needed since the interaction of the quantum degrees of freedom with classical space-time necessarily causes decoherence. We first derive the most general form of classical-quantum dynamics and consider realisations which have as its limit deterministic classical Hamiltonian evolution. The formalism is then applied to quantum field theory interacting with the classical space-time metric.

We develop the generalized formulation of quantum theory that stems from this approach and give a precise definition of time-reversal symmetry, emphasizing a previously overlooked distinction between states and effects.

Hence, the usual field equations give rise to modified Friedmann equations, in which the extra terms can be identified as an effective dark-energy sector. Additionally, we obtain an effective interaction between the matter and dark-energy sectors. In the case where the spin-gravity coupling switches off, we recover standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

To succeed, it is necessary to consider carefully how to choose a basis for the Lie algebra, and the ordering of the basis is important as well. For semisimple Lie algebras, one may take advantage of the root space decomposition to provide a basis with desirable properties. The problem of ordering leads us to introduce the concept of an admissible ordered basis (AOB). The existence of an AOB is established for some of the most important Lie algebras.

In the conventional approach, gravitational theories break this symmetry exhibited by all other physical systems.

This approach selects, in a very natural fashion, Einstein's general relativity in $d=4$. Developing this paradigm at a deeper level, one can obtain the distribution function for the atoms of space and connect it up with the thermodynamic description of spacetime.

These phases give rise to the two possible “statistics” that one observes. In two dimensions, however, a whole continuum of phases is possible. “Anyon” is a term coined in by Frank Wilczek to describe particles in 2 dimensions that can acquire “any” phase when two or more of them are interchanged. The exchange of two such anyons can be expressed via representations of the braid group and hence, it permits one to encode information in topological features of a system composed of many anyons.

In this paper, we identify the field observables recorded by such models. We show that in models that work in the strong coupling regime, the apparatus is correlated with smeared field amplitudes, while in models that work in weak coupling the apparatus records particle aspects of the field, such as the existence of a particle-like time of arrival and resonant absorption. Then, we develop an improved field-detector interaction model, adapting the formalism of Quantum Brownian motion, that is exactly solvable. This model confirms the association of field and particle properties in the strong and weak coupling regimes, respectively. Further, it can also describe the intermediate regime, in which the field-particle characteristics `merge'. In contrast to standard perturbation techniques, this model also recovers the relativistic Breit-Wigner resonant behavior in the weak coupling regime. The modulation of field-particle-duality by a single tunable parameter is a novel feature that is, in principle, experimentally accessible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Ramon","given":"Jose","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Anastopoulos","given":"Charis"}],"citation-key":"papageorgiouParticlefieldDualityQFT2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,28]]},"number":"arXiv:2308.14718","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Particle-field duality in QFT measurements","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14718"},

The authors present detailed, physically motivated, derivations of cosmological and black hole processes in which curved spacetime plays a key role.

  {"id":"pauling2012","abstract":"When this classic text was first published in 1935, it fulfilled the goal of its authors &quot;to produce a textbook of practical quantum mechanics for the chemist, the experimental physicist, and the beginning student of theoretical physics.&quot; Although many who are teachers today once worked with the book as students, the text is still as valuable for the same undergraduate audience.Two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, Research Professor at the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine, Palo Alto, California, and E. Bright Wilson, Jr., Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at Harvard University, provide a readily understandable study of &quot;wave mechanics,&quot; discussing the Schrodinger wave equation and the problems which can be solved with it. Extensive knowledge of mathematics is not required, although the student must have a grasp of elementary mathematics through the calculus. Pauling and Wilson begin with a survey of classical mechanics, including Newton&#39;s equations of motion in the Lagrangian form, and then move on to the &quot;old&quot; quantum theory, developed through the work of Planck, Einstein and Bohr. This analysis leads to the heart of the book ― an explanation of quantum mechanics which, as Schrodinger formulated it, &quot;involves the renunciation of the hope of describing in exact detail the behavior of a system.&quot; Physics had created a new realm in which classical, Newtonian certainties were replaced by probabilities ― a change which Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle (described in this book) subsequently reinforced.With clarity and precision, the authors guide the student from topic to topic, covering such subjects as the wave functions for the hydrogen atom, perturbation theory, the Pauli exclusion principle, the structure of simple and complex molecules, Van der Waals forces, and systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. To insure that the student can follow the mathematical derivations, Pauling and Wilson avoid the &quot;temptation to condense the various discussions into shorter and perhaps more elegant forms&quot; appropriate for a more advanced audience.

  {"id":"penrose1973","abstract":"Twistor theory offers a new approach, starting with conformally-invariant concepts, to the synthesis of quantum theory and relativity. Twistors for flat space-time are the SU(2,2) spinors of the twofold covering group O(2,4) of the conformal group. They describe the momentum and angular momentum structre of zero-rest-mass particles. Space-time points arise as secondary concepts corresponding to linear sets in twistor space. They, rather than the null cones, should become “smeared out” on passage to a quantised gravitational theory. Twistors are represented here in two-component spinor terms. Zero-rest-mass fields are described by holomorphic functions on twistor space, on which there is a natural canonical structure leading to a natural choice of canonical quantum operators. The generalisation to curved space can be accomplished in three ways; i) local twistors, a conformally invariant calculus, ii) global twistors, and iii) asymptotic twistors which provide the framework for an S-matrix approach in asymptotically flat space-times. A Hamiltonian scattering theory of global twistors is used to calculate scattering cross-sections. This leads to twistor analogues of Feynman graphs for the treatment of massless quantum electrodynamics.

  {"id":"penrose1999","abstract":"Relationships between current theories, and relationships between current theories and the sought theory of quantum gravity (QG), play an essential role in motivating the need for QG, aiding the search for QG, and defining what would count as QG. Correspondence is the broad class of inter-theory relationships intended to demonstrate the necessary compatibility of two theories whose domains of validity overlap, in the overlap regions. The variety of roles that correspondence plays in the search for QG are illustrated, using examples from specific QG approaches. Reduction is argued to be a special case of correspondence, and to form part of the definition of QG. Finally, the appropriate account of emergence in the context of QG is presented, and compared to conceptions of emergence in the broader philosophy literature. It is argued that, while emergence is likely to hold between QG and general relativity, emergence is not part of the definition of QG, and nor can it serve usefully in the development and justification of the new theory.\nWhen attempting to assess the strengths and weaknesses of various principles in their potential role of guiding the formulation of a theory of quantum gravity, it is crucial to distinguish between principles which are strongly supported by empirical data – either directly or indirectly – and principles which instead (merely) rely heavily on theoretical arguments for their justification. Principles in the latter category are not necessarily invalid, but their a priori foundational significance should be regarded with due caution. These remarks are illustrated in terms of the current standard models of cosmology and particle physics, as well as their respective underlying theories, i.e., essentially general relativity and quantum (field) theory. For instance, it is clear that both standard models are severely constrained by symmetry principles: an effective homogeneity and isotropy of the known universe on the largest scales in the case of cosmology and an underlying exact gauge symmetry of nuclear and electromagnetic interactions in the case of particle physics. However, in sharp contrast to the cosmological situation, where the relevant symmetry structure is more or less established directly on observational grounds, all known, nontrivial arguments for the “gauge principle” are purely theoretical (and far less conclusive than usually advocated). Similar remarks apply to the larger theoretical structures represented by general relativity and quantum (field) theory, where – actual or potential – empirical principles, such as the (Einstein) equivalence principle or EPR-type nonlocality, should be clearly differentiated from theoretical ones, such as general covariance or renormalizability. It is argued that if history is to be of any guidance, the best chance to obtain the key structural features of a putative quantum gravity theory is by deducing them, in some form, from the appropriate empirical principles (analogous to the manner in which, say, the idea that gravitation is a curved spacetime phenomenon is arguably implied by the equivalence principle). Theoretical principles may still be useful however in formulating a concrete theory (analogous to the manner in which, say, a suitable form of general covariance can still act as a sieve for separating theories of gravity from one another). It is subsequently argued that the appropriate empirical principles for deducing the key structural features of quantum gravity should at least include (i) quantum nonlocality, (ii) irreducible indeterminacy (or, essentially equivalently, given (i), relativistic causality), (iii) the thermodynamic arrow of time, (iv) homogeneity and isotropy of the observable universe on the largest scales. In each case, it is explained – when appropriate – how the principle in question could be implemented mathematically in a theory of quantum gravity, why it is considered to be of fundamental significance and also why contemporary accounts of it are insufficient. For instance, the high degree of uniformity observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background is usually regarded as theoretically problematic because of the existence of particle horizons, whereas the currently popular attempts to resolve this situation in terms of inflationary models are, for a number of reasons, less than satisfactory. However, rather than trying to account for the required empirical features dynamically, an arguably much more fruitful approach consists in attempting to account for these features directly, in the form of a lawlike initial condition within a theory of quantum gravity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Penrose","given":"Roger"}],"citation-key":"penrose1999","container-title":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","container-title-short":"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals","DOI":"10.1016/S0960-0779(98)00333-6","ISSN":"0960-0779","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"581-611","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Central Programme of Twistor Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077998003336","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"penrose2004","abstract":"A new type of algebra for Minkowski space‐time is described, in terms of which it is possible to express any conformally covariant or Poincaré covariant operation. The elements of the algebra (twistors) are combined according to tensor‐type rules, but they differ from tensors or spinors in that they describe locational properties in addition to directional ones. The representation of a null line by a pair of two‐component spinors, one of which defines the direction of the line and the other, its moment about the origin, gives the simplest type of twistor, with four complex components. The rules for generating other types of twistor are then determined by the geometry. One‐index twistors define a four‐dimensional, four‐valued (``spinor'') representation of the (restricted) conformal group. For the Poincaré group a skew‐symmetric metric twistor is introduced. Twistor space defines a complex projective three‐space C, which gives an alternative picture equivalent to the Minkowski space‐time M (which must be completed by a null cone at infinity). Points in C represent null lines or ``complexified'' null lines in M; lines in C represent real or complex points in M (so M, when complexified, is the Klein representation of C. Conformal transformations of M, including space and time reversals (and complex conjugation) are discussed in detail in twistor terms. A theorem of Kerr is described which shows that the complex analytic surfaces in C define the shear‐free null congruences in the real space M. Twistors are used to derive new theorems about the real geometry of M. The general twistor description of physical fields is left to a later paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Penrose","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"penrose2004","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","container-title-short":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.1705200","ISSN":"0022-2488","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",12,21]]},"page":"345-366","source":"Silverchair","title":"Twistor Algebra","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1705200","volume":"8"},

The single-qubit approximant presented in this work is operated through a series of gates that take as their parametrization the independent variable of the target function and an additional set of adjustable parameters. The independent variable is re-uploaded in every gate while the parameters are optimized for each target function. The output state of this quantum circuit becomes more accurate as the number of re-uploadings of the independent variable increases, i.e., as more layers of gates parameterized with the independent variable are applied. In this work, we provide two proofs of this claim related to both the Fourier series and the universal approximation theorem for neural networks, and we benchmark both methods against their classical counterparts. We further implement a single-qubit approximant in a real superconducting qubit device, demonstrating how the ability to describe a set of functions improves with the depth of the quantum circuit.

Specifically, we demonstrate enhancements in time-optimal control in the context of quantum circuit synthesis problems by applying novel deep learning algorithms in order to approximate geodesics (and thus minimal circuits) along Lie group manifolds relevant to low-dimensional multi-qubit systems, such as SU(2), SU(4) and SU(8). We demonstrate the superior performance of greybox models, which combine traditional blackbox algorithms with prior domain knowledge of quantum mechanics, as means of learning underlying quantum circuit distributions of interest. Our results demonstrate how geometric control techniques can be used to both (a) verify the extent to which geometrically synthesised quantum circuits lie along geodesic, and thus time-optimal, routes and (b) synthesise those circuits.

  {"id":"pittenger2002","abstract":"A ﬁnite-dimensional quantum mechanical system is modelled by a density ρ, a trace one, positive semi-definite matrix on a suitable tensor product space H [N]. For the system to demonstrate experimentally certain non-classical behavior, ρ cannot be in S, a closed convex set of densities whose extreme points have a speciﬁced tensor product form. Two mathematical problems in the quantum computing literature arise from this context: 1. the determination whether a given ρ is in S, and 2. a measure of the “entanglement” of such a ρ in terms of its distance from S. In this paper we describe these two problems in detail for a linear algebra audience, discuss some recent results from the quantum computing literature, and prove some new results. We emphasize the roles of densities ρ as both operators on the Hilbert space H [N] and also as points in a real Hilbert space M. We are able to compute the nearest separable densities τ0 to ρ0 in particular classes of inseparable densities and we use the Euclidean distance between the two in M to quantify the entanglement of ρ0. We also show the role of τ0 in the construction of separating hyperplanes, so-called entanglement witnesses in the quantum computing literature. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

  {"id":"plato2022","abstract":"The role of entanglement in determining the non-classicality of a given interaction has gained significant traction over the last few years. In particular, as the basis for new experimental proposals to test the quantum nature of the gravitational field. Here we show that the rate of gravity mediated entanglement between two otherwise isolated optomechanical systems can be significantly increased by modulating the optomechanical coupling. This is most pronounced for low mass, high frequency systems - convenient for reaching the quantum regime - and can lead to improvements of several orders of magnitude, as well as a broadening of the measurement window. Nevertheless, significant obstacles still remain. In particular, we find that modulations increase decoherence effects at the same rate as the entanglement improvements. This adds to the growing evidence that the constraint on noise (acting on the position d.o.f) depends only on the particle mass, separation, and temperature of the environment and cannot be improved by novel quantum control. Finally, we highlight the close connection between the observation of quantum correlations and the limits of measurement precision derived via the Cram\\'er-Rao Bound. An immediate consequence is that probing superpositions of the gravitational field places similar demands on detector sensitivity as entanglement verification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Plato","given":"A.

Mathematicians have been fascinated with the theory of error-correcting codes since the publication of Shannon's classic papers fifty years ago. With the proliferation of communications systems, computers, and digital audio devices that employ error-correcting codes, the theory has taken on practical importance in the solution of coding problems. This solution process requires the use of a wide variety of mathematical tools and an understanding of how to find mathematical techniques to solve applied problems.  Introduction to the Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, Third Edition demonstrates this process and prepares students to cope with coding problems. Like its predecessor, which was awarded a three-star rating by the Mathematical Association of America, this updated and expanded edition gives readers a firm grasp of the timeless fundamentals of coding as well as the latest theoretical advances.

  {"id":"pointing2024","abstract":"One hypothesis for the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is that they are highly expressive, which enables them to be applied to many problems, and they have a strong inductive bias towards solutions that are simple, known as simplicity bias, which allows them to generalise well on unseen data because most real-world data is structured (i.e. simple). In this work, we explore the inductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives us a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that it is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that this type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is possible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive bias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance compared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias can be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our results suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs we studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs either have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pointing","given":"Jessica"}],"citation-key":"pointing2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2407.03266","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Do Quantum Neural Networks have Simplicity Bias?","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03266"},

  {"id":"proctor2022","abstract":"Real-world quantum computers have grown sufficiently complex that they can no longer be simulated by classical supercomputers, but their computational power remains limited by errors. These errors corrupt the results of quantum algorithms, and it is no longer always feasible to use classical simulations to directly check the correctness of quantum computations. Without practical methods for quantifying the accuracy with which a quantum algorithm has been executed, it is difficult to establish trust in the results of a quantum computation. Here we solve this problem, by introducing a simple and efficient technique for measuring the fidelity with which an as-built quantum computer can execute an algorithm. Our technique converts the algorithm's quantum circuits into a set of closely related circuits whose success rates can be efficiently measured. It enables measuring the fidelity of quantum algorithm executions both in the near-term, with algorithms run on hundreds or thousands of physical qubits, and into the future, with algorithms run on logical qubits protected by quantum error correction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Proctor","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Seritan","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Rudinger","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Young","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Blume-Kohout","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Sarovar","given":"Mohan"}],"citation-key":"proctor2022","container-title":"arXiv:2204.07568 [quant-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,15]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Establishing trust in quantum computations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07568"},

  {"id":"puri2001","abstract":"This book provides an accessible introduction to the mathematical methods of quantum optics. Starting from first principles, it reveals how a given system of atoms and a field is mathematically modelled. The method of eigenfunction expansion and the Lie algebraic method for solving equations are outlined. Analytically exactly solvable classes of equations are identified. The text also discusses consequences of Lie algebraic properties of Hamiltonians, such as the classification of their states as coherent, classical or non-classical based on the generalized uncertainty relation and the concept of quasiprobability distributions. A unified approach is developed for determining the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level atom interacting with combinations of quantized fields under certain conditions. Simple methods for solving a variety of linear and nonlinear dissipative master equations are given. The book will be valuable to newcomers to the field and to experimentalists in quantum optics.","author":[{"family":"Puri","given":"Ravinder R."}],"citation-key":"puri2001","ISBN":"978-3-540-67802-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",1,18]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"312","publisher":"Springer Science & Business Media","source":"Google Books","title":"Mathematical Methods of Quantum Optics","type":"book"},
  {"id":"puri2012","abstract":"A sufficient condition for a quantum state of a system of spin-1/2 particles to admit a local hidden variable description, i.e., to be classical, is the separability of the density matrix characterizing its state, but not all classical states are separable. This leads one to infer that separability and classicality are two different concepts. These concepts are examined here in the framework of a criterion for identifying the classicality of a system of spin-1/2 particles based on the concept of joint quasiprobability (JQP) for the eigenvalues of spin components [Puri, J. Phys. A 29, 5719 (1996)]. The said criterion identifies a state as classical if a suitably defined JQP of the eigenvalues of spin components in three suitably chosen orthogonal directions is non-negative. In agreement with other approaches, the JQP-based criterion also leads to the result that all nonfactorizable pure states of two spin-1/2 particles are nonclassical. In this paper it is shown that the application of the said criterion to mixed states suggests that the states it identifies as classical are also separable and that there exist states which, identified as classical by other methods, may not be identified as classical by the criterion as it stands. However, results in agreement with the known ones are obtained if the criterion is modified to identify as classical also those states for which the JQP of the eigenvalues of the spin components in two of the three prescribed orthogonal directions is non-negative. The validity of the modified criterion is confirmed by comparing its predictions with those arrived at by other methods when applied to several mixed states of two spin-1/2 particles and the Werner-like state of three spin-1/2 particles [Tòth and Acìn, Phys. Rev. A 74, 030306(R) (2006)]. The JQP-based approach, formulated as it is along the lines of the P-function approach for identifying classical states of the electromagnetic field, offers a unified approach for systems of an arbitrary number of spin-1/2 particles and the possibility of linking classicality with the nature of the measurement process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Puri","given":"R.

  {"id":"queipo2005","abstract":"A major challenge to the successful full-scale development of modem aerospace systems is to address competing objectives such as improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced safety. Accurate, high-fidelity models are typically time consuming and computationally expensive. Furthermore, informed decisions should be made with an understanding of the impact (global sensitivity) of the design variables on the different objectives. In this context, the so-called surrogate-based approach for analysis and optimization can play a very valuable role. The surrogates are constructed using data drawn from high-fidelity models, and provide fast approximations of the objectives and constraints at new design points, thereby making sensitivity and optimization studies feasible. This paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the fundamental issues that arise in surrogate-based analysis and optimization (SBAO), highlighting concepts, methods, techniques, as well as practical implications. The issues addressed include the selection of the loss function and regularization criteria for constructing the surrogates, design of experiments, surrogate selection and construction, sensitivity analysis, convergence, and optimization. The multi-objective optimal design of a liquid rocket injector is presented to highlight the state of the art and to help guide future efforts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Queipo","given":"Nestor V."},{"family":"Haftka","given":"Raphael T."},{"family":"Shyy","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Goel","given":"Tushar"},{"family":"Vaidyanathan","given":"Raj"},{"family":"Tucker","given":"P.

  {"id":"rabin1963","abstract":"Probabilistic automata (p.a.) are a generalization of finite deterministic automata. We follow the formulation of finite automata in Rabin and Scott (1959) where the automata %plane1D;504; have two-valued output and thus can be viewed as defining the set T(%plane1D;504;) of all tapes accepted by %plane1D;504;. This involves no loss of generality. A p.a. is an automaton which, when in state s and when input is σ, has a probability pi(s, σ)} of going into any state si. With any cut-point 0 ≤ λ < 1, there is associated the set T(%plane1D;504;,λ) of tapes accepted by %plane1D;504; with cut-point λ. Here we develop a general theory of p.a. and solve some of the basic problems. Aside from the mathematical interest in pursuing this natural generalization of finite automata, the results also bear on questions of reliability of sequential circuits. P.a. are, in general, stronger than deterministic automata (Theorem 2). By studying the way we may want to use p.a. we are led to introduce the concept of isolated cut-point. It turns out that every p.a. with isolated cut-point is equivalent to a suitable deterministic automaton (the Reduction Theorem 3). It is interesting to note that in passing from a minimal deterministic automaton to an equivalent p.a. we can sometimes save states (Section VII). The Reduction Theorem is applied to prove the existence of an approximate calculation procedure for a calculation problem involving products of stochastic matrices (Section VIII). The problem is of a new kind in that there is no a-priori bound on the number of operations (matrix multiplications) which we may have to perform and therefore classical numerical estimates of round-off errors do not apply. Actual automata (Definition 9) have the property, often existing in actual unreliable circuits, that all transition probabilities are strictly positive. Actual automata are proved to give only definite events. This points to the restrictions we may have to impose on a probabilistic sequential circuit if we want it to perform general tasks, namely, some transitions should be prohibited. Finally we treat the important problem of stability. Is the operation of a p.a. stable (unchanged) under small enough perturbations of the transition probabilities? We have an affirmative answer to this question in the case of actual automata (Theorem 11) and we discuss the problem for the general case.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rabin","given":"Michael O."}],"citation-key":"rabin1963","container-title":"Information and Control","container-title-short":"Information and Control","DOI":"10.1016/S0019-9958(63)90290-0","ISSN":"0019-9958","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1963",9,1]]},"page":"230-245","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Probabilistic automata","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995863902900","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"ramseyProgrammingLanguagesBuild2022","abstract":"Computer scientists often need to learn new programming languages quickly. The best way to prepare for this is to understand the foundational principles that underlie even the most complicated industrial languages. This text for an undergraduate programming languages course distills great languages and their design principles down to easy-to-learn 'bridge' languages implemented by interpreters whose key parts are explained in the text. The book goes deep into the roots of both functional and object-oriented programming, and it shows how types and modules, including generics/polymorphism, contribute to effective programming. The book is not just about programming languages; it is also about programming. Through concepts, examples, and more than 300 practice exercises that exploit the interpreter, students learn not only what programming-language features are but also how to do things with them. Substantial implementation projects include Milner's type inference, both copying and mark-and-sweep garbage collection, and arithmetic on arbitrary-precision integers.","author":[{"family":"Ramsey","given":"Norman"}],"citation-key":"ramseyProgrammingLanguagesBuild2022","ISBN":"978-1-107-18018-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"799","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare","title-short":"Programming Languages","type":"book"},

Our construction applies to all finite dimensions, with the most interesting case being that of qubits. For multiple qubits, we find that quantum computation by Clifford gates and Pauli measurements on magic states can be efficiently classically simulated if the quasiprobability distribution of the magic states is non-negative. This provides the so far missing qubit counterpart of the corresponding result [V. Veitch et al., New J. Phys. 14, 113011 (2012)] applying only to odd dimension. Our approach is more general than previous ones based on mixtures of stabilizer states. Namely, all mixtures of stabilizer states can be efficiently simulated, but for any number of qubits there also exist efficiently simulable states outside the stabilizer polytope. Further, our simulation method extends to negative quasiprobability distributions, where it provides amplitude estimation. The simulation cost is then proportional to a robustness measure squared. For all quantum states, this robustness is smaller than or equal to robustness of magic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Raussendorf","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Bermejo-Vega","given":"Juani"},{"family":"Tyhurst","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Okay","given":"Cihan"},{"family":"Zurel","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"raussendorf2020a","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"raussendorf2022","abstract":"A web of cohomological facts relates quantum error correction, measurement-based quantum computation, symmetry protected topological order and contextuality. Here we extend this web to quantum computation with magic states. In this computational scheme, the negativity of certain quasiprobability functions is an indicator for quantumness. However, when constructing quasiprobability functions to which this statement applies, a marked difference arises between the cases of even and odd local Hilbert space dimension. At a technical level, establishing negativity as an indicator of quantumness in quantum computation with magic states relies on two properties of the Wigner function: their covariance with respect to the Clifford group and positive representation of Pauli measurements. In odd dimension, Gross' Wigner function -- an adaptation of the original Wigner function to odd-finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces -- possesses these properties. In even dimension, Gross' Wigner function doesn't exist. Here we discuss the broader class of Wigner functions that, like Gross', are obtained from operator bases. We find that such Clifford-covariant Wigner functions do not exist in any even dimension, and furthermore, Pauli measurements cannot be positively represented by them in any even dimension whenever the number of qudits is n>=2. We establish that the obstructions to the existence of such Wigner functions are cohomological.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Raussendorf","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Okay","given":"Cihan"},{"family":"Zurel","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Feldmann","given":"Polina"}],"citation-key":"raussendorf2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"number":"arXiv:2110.11631","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The role of cohomology in quantum computation with magic states","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11631"},

Typically the EFT equations of motion consist of an expansion involving higher and higher derivatives of the ﬁelds, whose truncation at any ﬁnite order may not be well-posed. In this paper we address the question of how to make sense of the EFT equations of motion, and whether they provide a good approximation to the classical UV theory. We propose an approach to solving EFTs which leads to a well-posedness statement. For a particular choice of UV theory we rigorously derive the corresponding EFT and show that a large class of classical solutions to the UV theory are well approximated by EFT solutions. We also consider solutions of the UV theory which are not well approximated by EFT solutions and demonstrate that these are close, in an averaged sense, to solutions of a modiﬁed EFT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Reall","given":"Harvey S."},{"family":"Warnick","given":"Claude M."}],"citation-key":"reall2022","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/5.0075455","ISSN":"0022-2488, 1089-7658","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"042901","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Effective field theory and classical equations of motion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12028","volume":"63"},

  {"id":"reed1979","abstract":"Scattering theory is the study of an interacting system on a scale of time and/or distance which is large compared to the scale of the interaction itself. As such, it is the most effective means, sometimes the only means, to study microscopic nature. To understand the importance of scattering theory, consider the variety of ways in which it arises. First, there are various phenomena in nature (like the blue of the sky) which are the result of scattering. In order to understand the phenomenon (and to identify it as the result of scattering) one must understand the underlying dynamics and its scattering theory. Second, one often wants to use the scattering of waves or particles whose dynamics on knows to determine the structure and position of small or inaccessible objects. For example, in x-ray crystallography (which led to the discovery of DNA), tomography, and the detection of underwater objects by sonar, the underlying dynamics is well understood. What one would like to construct are correspondences that link, via the dynamics, the position, shape, and internal structure of the object to the scattering data. Ideally, the correspondence should be an explicit formula which allows one to reconstruct, at least approximately, the object from the scattering data. The main test of any proposed particle dynamics is whether one can construct for the dynamics a scattering theory that predicts the observed experimental data. Scattering theory was not always so central the physics. Even thought the Coulomb cross section could have been computed by Newton, had he bothered to ask the right question, its calculation is generally attributed to Rutherford more than two hundred years later. Of course, Rutherford's calculation was in connection with the first experiment in nuclear physics.","author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Barry"}],"citation-key":"reed1979","ISBN":"978-0-08-092538-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979",5,29]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"480","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"Google Books","title":"Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics: Scattering theory","title-short":"III","type":"book"},

The authors writing style and penchant for description energize interest in condensed matter physics as well as provide a conceptual grounding with information that is crystal clear and memorable.Reif first introduces basic probability concepts and statistical methods used throughout all of physics. Statistical ideas are then applied to systems of particles in equilibrium to enhance an understanding of the basic notions of statistical mechanics, from which derive the purely macroscopic general statements of thermodynamics. Next, he turns to the more complicated equilibrium situations, such as phase transformations and quantum gases, before discussing nonequilibrium situations in which he treats transport theory and dilute gases at varying levels of sophistication. In the last chapter, he addresses some general questions involving irreversible processes and fluctuations.A large amount of material is presented to facilitate students later access to more advanced works, to allow those with higher levels of curiosity to read beyond the minimum given on a topic, and to enhance understanding by presenting several ways of looking at a particular question.

Its organization permits an instructor to vary the length and depth of his treatment and to use the book either with or following classical physics. These features make it an ideal companion for introductory courses.","author":[{"family":"Resnick","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"resnick1968","ISBN":"978-0-471-71725-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1968",1,15]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"248","publisher":"Wiley","source":"Google Books","title":"Introduction to Special Relativity","type":"book"},

  {"id":"rezvanian2018","abstract":"This book collects recent theoretical advances and concrete applications of learning automata (LAs) in various areas of computer science, presenting a broad treatment of the computer science field in a survey style. Learning automata (LAs) have proven to be effective decision-making agents, especially within unknown stochastic environments. The book starts with a brief explanation of LAs and their baseline variations. It subsequently introduces readers to a number of recently developed, complex structures used to supplement LAs, and describes their steady-state behaviors. These complex structures have been developed because, by design, LAs are simple units used to perform simple tasks; their full potential can only be tapped when several interconnected LAs cooperate to produce a group synergy.In turn, the next part of the book highlights a range of LA-based applications in diverse computer science domains, from wireless sensor networks, to peer-to-peer networks, to complex social networks, and finally to Petri nets. The book accompanies the reader on a comprehensive journey, starting from basic concepts, continuing to recent theoretical findings, and ending in the applications of LAs in problems from numerous research domains. As such, the book offers a valuable resource for all computer engineers, scientists, and students, especially those whose work involves the reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence domains.","author":[{"family":"Rezvanian","given":"Alireza"},{"family":"Saghiri","given":"Ali Mohammad"},{"family":"Vahidipour","given":"Seyed Mehdi"},{"family":"Esnaashari","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Meybodi","given":"Mohammad Reza"}],"citation-key":"rezvanian2018","ISBN":"978-3-319-72428-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,17]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"471","publisher":"Springer","source":"Google Books","title":"Recent Advances in Learning Automata","type":"book"},
  {"id":"rickles2006","abstract":"Quantum gravity is the name given to a theory that unites general relativity - Einstein's theory of gravitation and spacetime - with quantum field theory, our framework for describing non-gravitational forces. The Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity brings together philosophers and physicists to discuss a range of conceptual issues that surface in the effort to unite these theories, focusing in particular on the ontological nature of the spacetime that results. Although there has been a great deal written about quantum gravity from the perspective of physicists and mathematicians, very little attention has been paid to the philosophical aspects. This volume closes that gap, with essays written by some of the leading researchers in the field. Individual papers defend or attack a structuralist perspective on the fundamental ontologies of our physical theories, which offers the possibility of shedding new light on a number of foundational problems. It is a book that will be of interest not only to physicists and philosophers of physics but to anyone concerned with foundational issues and curious to explore new directions in our understanding of spacetime and quantum physics.","author":[{"family":"Rickles","given":"Dean"},{"family":"French","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Saatsi","given":"Juha T."}],"citation-key":"rickles2006","ISBN":"978-0-19-926969-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11,16]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"283","publisher":"Clarendon Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity","type":"book"},

When such transitions from one state to another take place, fluctuations, i.e., random processes, may play an im portant role. Over the past decades it has turned out that the Fokker-Planck equation pro vides a powerful tool with which the effects of fluctuations close to transition points can be adequately treated and that the approaches based on the Fokker Planck equation are superior to other approaches, e.g., based on Langevin equa tions. Quite generally, the Fokker-Planck equation plays an important role in problems which involve noise, e.g., in electrical circuits. For these reasons I am sure that this book will find a broad audience. It pro vides the reader with a sound basis for the study of the Fokker-Planck equation and gives an excellent survey of the methods of its solution. The author of this book, Hannes Risken, has made substantial contributions to the development and application of such methods, e.g., to laser physics, diffusion in periodic potentials, and other problems.

It covers the essentials of the subject starting from basic undergraduate mathematics. The correspondence between linear Lie groups and Lie algebras is developed in its local and global aspects. The classical groups are analyzed in detail, first with elementary matrix methods, then with the help of the structural tools typical of the theory of semisimple groups, such as Cartan subgroups, root, weights and reflections.

Manifolds are introduced when needed, in connection with homogeneous spaces, and the elements of differential and integral calculus on manifolds are presented, with special emphasis on integration on groups and homogeneous spaces.

Two unique and different methods have been devised for this classification.

In the second method, the classification is done by changing some predefined bit positions with respect to the affine function belonging to that class. The bit positions which are changing also provide us information concerning the size and symmetry properties of the classes/subclasses in such a way that the members of classes/subclasses satisfy certain similar properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Rout","given":"Ranjeet Kumar"},{"family":"Pal Choudhury","given":"Pabitra"},{"family":"Sahoo","given":"Sudhakar"}],"citation-key":"rout2013","container-title":"Journal of Discrete Mathematics","DOI":"10.1155/2013/270424","ISSN":"2090-9837","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,31]]},"language":"en","page":"e270424","publisher":"Hindawi","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"Classification of Boolean Functions Where Affine Functions Are Uniformly Distributed","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jdm/2013/270424/","volume":"2013"},

Gravity is intimately connected with the structure of space and time, and understanding quantum gravity requires us to find a conceptual structure appropriate to make sense of the quantum aspects of space and time. In the course of the last decades, an extensive discussion on this problem has led to a clear conceptual picture, that provides a coherent conceptual foundation of today's Loop Quantum Gravity. We review this foundation, addressing issues such as the sense in which space and time are emergent, the notion of locality, the role of truncation that enables physical computations on finite graphs, the problem of time, and the characterization of the observable quantities in quantum gravity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Rovelli","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Vidotto","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"rovelli2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2211.06718","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,12]]},"number":"arXiv:2211.06718","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Philosophical Foundations of Loop Quantum Gravity","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06718"},

  {"id":"roy2022","abstract":"This paper illustrates a direct connection between quantum steering and non-trivial preparation contextuality. In two party-two measurement per party-two outcomes per measurement $(2-2-2)$ Bell scenario, any argument of Bell nonlocality is a proof of trivial preparation contextuality; however, the converse may not hold. If one of the parties (say, Alice) performs the measurements of more than two dichotomic observables, then it is possible to find a set of non-trivial functional relations between Alice's observables. We argue that the existence of a suitable set of such non-trivial relations between Alice's observables may warrant the unsteerability of quantum states at the end of another spatially separated party (say, Bob). Interestingly, such constraints can be read as non-trivial preparation non-contextuality assumptions in an ontological model. We further demonstrate two types of Bell inequalities that can be converted into linear steering inequalities using the aforementioned non-trivial conditions on Alice's observables. Such steering inequalities can also be considered as non-trivial preparation noncontextual inequalities. Since the local bound of the family of Bell expression gets reduced under the additional non-trivial conditions, it provides a test of quantum steering and nonlocality from the same family of Bell expressions depending upon its violation of the non-trivial preparation non-contextual or the local bound, thereby establishing a direct connection between quantum steering and non-trivial preparation contextuality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Prabuddha"},{"family":"Pan","given":"A.

  {"id":"schafer2018","abstract":"Hamiltonian formalisms provide powerful tools for the computation of approximate analytic solutions of the Einstein field equations. The post-Newtonian computations of the explicit analytic dynamics and motion of compact binaries are discussed within the most often applied Arnowitt–Deser–Misner formalism. The obtention of autonomous Hamiltonians is achieved by the transition to Routhians. Order reduction of higher derivative Hamiltonians results in standard Hamiltonians. Tetrad representation of general relativity is introduced for the tackling of compact binaries with spinning components. Configurations are treated where the absolute values of the spin vectors can be considered constant. Compact objects are modeled by use of Dirac delta functions and their derivatives. Consistency is achieved through transition to d-dimensional space and application of dimensional regularization. At the fourth post-Newtonian level, tail contributions to the binding energy show up. The conservative spin-dependent dynamics finds explicit presentation in Hamiltonian form through next-to-next-to-leading-order spin–orbit and spin1–spin2 couplings and to leading-order in the cubic and quartic in spin interactions. The radiation reaction dynamics is presented explicitly through the third-and-half post-Newtonian order for spinless objects, and, for spinning bodies, to leading-order in the spin–orbit and spin1–spin2 couplings. The most important historical issues get pointed out.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Gerhard"},{"family":"Jaranowski","given":"Piotr"}],"citation-key":"schafer2018","container-title":"Living Reviews in Relativity","container-title-short":"Living Rev Relativ","DOI":"10.1007/s41114-018-0016-5","ISSN":"1433-8351","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"7","source":"Springer Link","title":"Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity and post-Newtonian dynamics of compact binaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41114-018-0016-5","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"schwinger1948","abstract":"Attempts to avoid the divergence difficulties of quantum electrodynamics by multilation of the theory have been uniformly unsuccessful. The lack of convergence does indicate that a revision of electrodynamic concepts at ultrarelativistic energies is indeed necessary, but no appreciable alteration of the theory for moderate relativistic energies can be tolerated. The elementary phenomena in which divergences occur, in consequence of virtual transitions involving particles with unlimited energy, are the polarization of the vacuum and the self-energy of the electron, effects which essentially express the interaction of the electromagnetic and matter fields with their own vacuum fluctuations. The basic result of these fluctuation interactions is to alter the constants characterizing the properties of the individual fields, and their mutual coupling, albeit by infinite factors. The question is naturally posed whether all divergences can be isolated in such unobservable renormalization factors; more specifically, we inquire whether quantum electrodynamics can account unambiguously for the recently observed deviations from the Dirac electron theory, without the introduction of fundamentally new concepts. This paper, the first in a series devoted to the above question, is occupied with the formulation of a completely covariant electrodynamics. Manifest covariance with respect to Lorentz and gauge transformations is essential in a divergent theory since the use of a particular reference system or gauge in the course of calculation can result in a loss of covariance in view of the ambiguities that may be the concomitant of infinities. It is remarked, in the first section, that the customary canonical commutation relations, which fail to exhibit the desired covariance since they refer to field variables at equal times and different points of space, can be put in covariant form by replacing the four-dimensional surface t=const. by a space-like surface. The latter is such that light signals cannot be propagated between any two points on the surface. In this manner, a formulation of quantum electrodynamics is constructed in the Heisenberg representation, which is obviously covariant in all its aspects. It is not entirely suitable, however, as a practical means of treating electrodynamic questions, since commutators of field quantities at points separated by a time-like interval can be constructed only by solving the equations of motion. This situation is to be contrasted with that of the Schrödinger representation, in which all operators refer to the same time, thus providing a distinct separation between kinematical and dynamical aspects. A formulation that retains the evident covariance of the Heisenberg representation, and yet offers something akin to the advantage of the Schrödinger representation can be based on the distinction between the properties of non-interacting fields, and the effects of coupling between fields. In the second section, we construct a canonical transformation that changes the field equations in the Heisenberg representation into those of non-interacting fields, and therefore describes the coupling between fields in terms of a varying state vector. It is then a simple matter to evaluate commutators of field quantities at arbitrary space-time points. One thus obtains an obviously convariant and practical form of quantum electrodynamics, expressed in a mixed Heisenberg-Schrödinger representation, which is called the interaction representation. The third section is devoted to a discussion of the covariant elimination of the longitudinal field, in which the customary distinction between longitudinal and transverse fields is replaced by a suitable covariant definition. The fourth section is concerned with the description of collision processes in terms of an invariant collision operator, which is the unitary operator that determines the over-all change in state of a system as the result of interaction. It is shown that the collision operator is simply related to the Hermitian reaction operator, for which a variational principle is constructed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwinger","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"schwinger1948","container-title":"Physical Review","container-title-short":"Phys.

But the computer revolution of recent years has provided access to data of unprecedented complexity in ever-growing volume. New tools are required to detect and summarize the multivariate structure of these difficult data. Multivariate Density Estimation: Theory, Practice, and Visualization demonstrates that density estimation retains its explicative power even when applied to trivariate and quadrivariate data. By presenting the major ideas in the context of the classical histogram, the text simplifies the understanding of advanced estimators and develops links between the intuitive histogram and other methods that are more statistically efficient. The theoretical results covered are those particularly relevant to application and understanding. The focus is on methodology, new ideas, and practical advice. A hierarchical approach draws attention to the similarities among different estimators. Also, detailed discussions of nonparametric dimension reduction, nonparametric regression, additive modeling, and classification are included. Because visualization is a key element in effective multivariate nonparametric analysis, more than 100 graphic illustrations supplement the numerous problems and examples presented in the text. In addition, sixteen four-color plates help to convey an intuitive feel for both the theory and practice of density estimation in several dimensions.

  {"id":"seevinck2007","abstract":"By introducing a quantitative “degree of commutativity” in terms of the angle between spin observables we present two tight quantitative trade-off relations in the case of two qubits. First, for entangled states, between the degree of commutativity of local observables and the maximal amount of violation of the Bell inequality: if both local angles increase from zero to π∕2 (i.e., the degree of local commutativity decreases), the maximum violation of the Bell inequality increases. Secondly, a converse trade-off relation holds for separable states: if both local angles approach π∕2 the maximal value obtainable for the correlations in the Bell inequality decreases and thus the non-violation increases. As expected, the extremes of these relations are found in the case of anticommuting local observables where, respectively, the bounds of 2√2 and √2 hold for the expectation value of the Bell operator. The trade-off relations show that noncommmutativity gives “a more than classical result” for entangled states, whereas “a less than classical result” is obtained for separable states. The experimental relevance of the trade-off relation for separable states is that it provides an experimental test for two qubit entanglement. Its advantages are twofold: in comparison to violations of Bell inequalities it is a stronger criterion and in comparison to entanglement witnesses it needs to make less strong assumptions about the observables implemented in the experiment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Seevinck","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Uffink","given":"Jos"}],"citation-key":"seevinck2007","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

The effectiveness of our approach is shown by obtaining multi-dimensional energy surfaces for small molecules and a spin model. Our method solves related variational problems in parallel by exploiting the global nature of Bayesian optimisation and sharing information between different optimisers. Parallelisation makes our method ideally suited to the next generation of variational problems with many physical degrees of freedom. This addresses a key challenge in scaling-up quantum algorithms towards demonstrating quantum advantage for problems of real-world interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Self","given":"Chris N."},{"family":"Khosla","given":"Kiran E."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Alistair W.

  {"id":"sen2019","abstract":"Even at tree level, the first quantized string theory suffers from apparent short distance singularities associated with collision of vertex operators that prevent us from straightforward numerical computation of various quantities. Examples include string theory S-matrix for generic external momenta and computation of the spectrum of string theory under a marginal deformation of the world-sheet theory. The former requires us to define the S-matrix via analytic continuation or as limits of contour integrals in complexified moduli space, while the latter requires us to use an ultraviolet cut-off at intermediate steps. In contrast, string field theory does not suffer from such divergences. In this paper we show how string field theory can be used to generate an explicit algorithm for computing tree level amplitudes in any string theory that does not suffer from any short distance divergence from integration over the world-sheet variables. We also use string field theory to compute second order mass shift of string states under a marginal deformation without having to use any cut-off at intermediate steps. We carry out the analysis in a broad class of string field theories, thereby making it manifest that the final results are independent of the extra data that go into the formulation of string field theory. We also comment on the generalization of this analysis to higher genus amplitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Ashoke"}],"citation-key":"sen2019","container-title":"Journal of High Energy Physics","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"sen2024","abstract":"As of today there exist consistent, gauge-invariant string field theories describing all string theories: bosonic open and closed strings, open superstrings, heterotic strings and type II strings. The construction of these theories require algebraic ingredients, such as $A_\\infty$ and $L_\\infty$ homotopy algebras, geometric ingredients, relevant to the building of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and the distribution of picture changing operators, and field-theoretic ingredients, involving two-dimensional CFT's and BCFT's and Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. Applications of string field theory include the description of non-perturbative phenomena such as tachyon condensation and classical solutions, and the resolution of a number of ambiguities that bedevil the world-sheet formulation of perturbative string theory. It also allows, given a proper definition of contours of integration for momenta, for a proof of unitarity and a clear understanding of the ultraviolet finiteness of the theory.

The goal of these algorithms is to perform large quantum computations by breaking the problem down into a large number of shallow quantum circuits, complemented by classical optimization and feedback between each circuit execution. One path for improving the performance of these algorithms is to enhance the classical optimization technique. Given the relative ease and abundance of classical computing resources, there is ample opportunity to do so. In this work, we introduce the idea of learning surrogate models for variational circuits using a few experimental measurements, and then performing parameter optimization using these models as opposed to the original data. We demonstrate this idea using a surrogate model based on kernel approximations, through which we reconstruct local patches of variational cost functions using batches of noisy quantum circuit results. Through application to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and preparation of ground states for molecules, we demonstrate the superiority of surrogate-based optimization over commonly used optimization techniques for variational algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shaffer","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Kocia","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Sarovar","given":"Mohan"}],"citation-key":"shaffer2023","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

These techniques are useful in achieving robust and low-cost solutions. However, engineers face difficulties in making an optimal choice of the soft computing technique to solve the complex problems related to TBM tunneling. To help with this choice, this study presents state of the art about the use of soft computing techniques in TBM tunneling through practical applications. The study proposes recommendations for the optimal use of these techniques, in particular (i) the importance of preliminary analyses for the selection and reduction of input parameters, (ii) the necessity to complete insufficient data using laboratory tests and numerical modeling, (iii) the selection of reduced number of hidden layers and nodes to avoid overfitting, (iv) the use of recurrent neural networks to deal with time-series data, and (v) the association of soft computing methods with hybrid optimization techniques to reduce the risk of convergence to local minima.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shahrour","given":"Isam"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wengang"}],"citation-key":"shahrour2021","container-title":"Underground Space","container-title-short":"Underground Space","DOI":"10.1016/j.undsp.2019.12.001","ISSN":"2467-9674","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"page":"233-239","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Use of soft computing techniques for tunneling optimization of tunnel boring machines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2467967419300972","volume":"6"},

Our chosen setting is suitable for infinite-dimensional diagrammatic reasoning, generalising the ZX calculus and other algebraic gadgets familiar to the categorical quantum theory community. The Feynman diagrams we define look very similar to their traditional counterparts, but are more general: instead of depicting scattering amplitude, they embody the linear maps from which the amplitudes themselves are computed, for any given initial and final particle states. This shift in perspective reflects into a formal transition from the syntactic, graph-theoretic compositionality of traditional Feynman diagrams to a semantic, categorical-diagrammatic compositionality. Because we work in a concrete categorical setting -- powered by non-standard analysis -- we are able to take direct advantage of complex additive structure in our description. This makes it possible to derive a particularly compelling characterisation for the sequential composition of categorical Feynman diagrams, which automatically results in the superposition of all possible graph-theoretic combinations of the individual diagrams themselves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Shaikh","given":"Razin A."},{"family":"Gogioso","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"shaikh2022","container-title":"arXiv:2205.00466 [quant-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,1]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Categorical Semantics for Feynman Diagrams","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00466"},

To describe the quantum measurement process we must couple the classical apparatus to the quantum system. In this paper we explain how this is to be done: we embed the classical apparatus into a larger quantum-mechanical structure, making use of a superselection principle. The apparatus can now be coupled to the quantum system in a straightforward manner. We discuss what constraints should be placed on the coupling so that an interpretation of the interaction as a measurement results. We require that unambiguous information of the values of a quantum observable should be transferred to the variables of the apparatus. We also require that the apparatus should retain its classical identity.

  {"id":"shin2023","abstract":"Variational quantum machine learning (VQML), which employs variational quantum circuits as computational models for machine learning, is considered one of the most promising applications for near-term quantum devices. We represent a VQML model as a tensor network (TN) and analyze it in the context of the TN. We identify the model as a featured linear model (FLM) with a constrained coefficient where the feature map is given by the tensor products. This allows us to create the same feature map classically in an efficient way using only the same amount of pre-processing as VQML, resulting in a classical TN machine learning model that exists within the function space spanned by the same basis functions as VQML models. By representing the coefficient components of the models using matrix product states (MPS), we analyze the coefficients of the VQML model and determine the conditions for efficient approximation of VQML models by classical models. Finally, we compare the performance of the VQML and classical models in function regression tasks using kernel and variational methods, highlighting the distinct characteristics between them.

In this work, we introduced the dequantizability of the function class of variational quantum-machine-learning~(VQML) models by employing the tensor network formalism, effectively identifying every VQML model as a subclass of matrix product state (MPS) model characterized by constrained coefficient MPS and tensor product-based feature maps. From this formalism, we identify the conditions for which a VQML model's function class is dequantizable or not. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient quantum kernel-induced classical kernel which is as expressive as given any quantum kernel, hinting at a possible way to dequantize quantum kernel methods. This presents a thorough analysis of VQML models and demonstrates the versatility of our tensor-network formalism to properly distinguish VQML models according to their genuine quantum characteristics, thereby unifying classical and quantum machine-learning models within a single framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Shin","given":"Seongwook"},{"family":"Teo","given":"Yong Siah"},{"family":"Jeong","given":"Hyunseok"}],"citation-key":"shin2023a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,21]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2307.06937","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Dequantizing quantum machine learning models using tensor networks","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06937"},

Starting with the action integral which ensures the masslessness of particles, two possibilities to introduce spin are investigated. In both cases, the equations of motion cannot fix the world line of massless spinning particles uniquely, due to a “gauge” invariance property of the action integral. The space-time coordinates are not the most suitable for describing massless spinning particles, but it is convenient to take a pair of spinor variables, i.e., a twistor, as the basic dynamical variables to which the canonical quantization procedure can be applied. In one of the two cases, where massless particles are considered to move in superspace with N spinor coordinates, it is found that massless particles form a spin (or helicity) multiplet with the helicity running from - N/4 to +N/4.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Shirafuji","given":"Takeshi"}],"citation-key":"shirafuji1983","container-title":"Progress of Theoretical Physics","container-title-short":"Progress of Theoretical Physics","DOI":"10.1143/PTP.70.18","ISSN":"0033-068X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983",7,1]]},"page":"18-35","source":"Silverchair","title":"Lagrangian Mechanics of Massless Particles with Spin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1143/PTP.70.18","volume":"70"},

As the performance of traditional Von Neumann machines is greatly hindered by the increasing performance gap between CPU and memory (“known as the memory wall”), neuromorphic computing systems have gained considerable attention. The biology-plausible computing paradigm carries out computing by emulating the charging/discharging process of neuron and synapse potential. The unique spike domain information encoding enables asynchronous event driven computation and communication, and hence has the potential for very high energy efficiency. This survey reviews computing models and hardware platforms of existing neuromorphic computing systems. Neuron and synapse models are first introduced, followed by the discussion on how they will affect hardware design. Case studies of several representative hardware platforms, including their architecture and software ecosystems, are further presented.

In approaches to quantum computation based on superconducting circuits, as one goes from bulk materials to functional devices, amorphous films and non-equilibrium excitations — electronic and phononic — are introduced, leading to dissipation and fluctuations that limit the computational power of state-of-the-art qubits and processors. In this Review, the major sources of decoherence in superconducting qubits are identified through an exploration of seminal qubit and resonator experiments. The proposed microscopic mechanisms associated with these imperfections are summarized, and directions for future research are discussed. The trade-offs between simple qubit primitives based on a single Josephson tunnel junction and more complex designs that use additional circuit elements, or new junction modalities, to reduce sensitivity to local noise sources are discussed, particularly in the context of materials optimization strategies for each architecture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Siddiqi","given":"Irfan"}],"citation-key":"siddiqi2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Materials","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Mater","DOI":"10.1038/s41578-021-00370-4","ISSN":"2058-8437","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"10","page":"875-891","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Engineering high-coherence superconducting qubits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-021-00370-4","volume":"6"},

In particular, gravitational time dilation is believed to decohere superpositions of center of mass of composite quantum systems. Since true effects of gravity are encoded in the curvature of spacetime, the universality of such a decoherence must be characterized through components of Riemann tensor $R_{abcd}$, with a clear separation from non-inertial kinematic effects. We obtain the reduced density matrix of a composite system in a generic curved spacetime, and express the decoherence time scale explicitly in terms of curvature. The decoherence in an inertial frame is caused by tidal acceleration.

  {"id":"skolik2022","abstract":"Quantum machine learning (QML) has been identified as one of the key fields that could reap advantages from near-term quantum devices, next to optimization and quantum chemistry. Research in this area has focused primarily on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and several proposals to enhance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with VQAs have been put forward. Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Skolik","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Jerbi","given":"Sofiene"},{"family":"Dunjko","given":"Vedran"}],"citation-key":"skolik2022","container-title":"Quantum","container-title-short":"Quantum","DOI":"10.22331/q-2022-05-24-720","ISSN":"2521-327X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"page":"720","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Quantum agents in the Gym: a variational quantum algorithm for deep Q-learning","title-short":"Quantum agents in the Gym","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15084","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"smith2014","abstract":"The techniques and analysis presented in this paper provide new methods to solve optimization problems posed on Riemannian manifolds. A new point of view is offered for the solution of constrained optimization problems. Some classical optimization techniques on Euclidean space are generalized to Riemannian manifolds. Several algorithms are presented and their convergence properties are analyzed employing the Riemannian structure of the manifold. Specifically, two apparently new algorithms, which can be thought of as Newton's method and the conjugate gradient method on Riemannian manifolds, are presented and shown to possess, respectively, quadratic and superlinear convergence. Examples of each method on certain Riemannian manifolds are given with the results of numerical experiments. Rayleigh's quotient defined on the sphere is one example. It is shown that Newton's method applied to this function converges cubically, and that the Rayleigh quotient iteration is an efficient approximation of Newton's method. The Riemannian version of the conjugate gradient method applied to this function gives a new algorithm for finding the eigenvectors corresponding to the extreme eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix. Another example arises from extremizing the function $\\mathop{\\rm tr} {\\Theta}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm T}Q{\\Theta}N$ on the special orthogonal group. In a similar example, it is shown that Newton's method applied to the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal entries of a symmetric matrix converges cubically.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Steven Thomas"}],"citation-key":"smith2014","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1407.5965","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,22]]},"number":"arXiv:1407.5965","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Optimization Techniques on Riemannian Manifolds","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5965"},

  {"id":"smith2023","abstract":"We present a new optimization strategy for small-to-intermediate scale variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) on noisy near-term quantum processors which uses a Gaussian process surrogate model equipped with a classically-evaluated quantum kernel. VQAs are typically optimized using gradient-based approaches however these are difficult to implement on current noisy devices, requiring large numbers of objective function evaluations. Our approach shifts this computational burden onto the classical optimizer component of these hybrid algorithms, greatly reducing the number of quantum circuit evaluations required from the quantum processor. We focus on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and demonstrate numerically that these surrogate models are particularly well suited to the algorithm’s objective function. Next, we apply these models to both noiseless and noisy VQE simulations and show that they exhibit better performance than widely-used classical kernels in terms of final accuracy and convergence speed. Compared to the typically-used stochastic gradient-descent approach to VQAs, our quantum kernel-based approach is found to consistently achieve significantly higher accuracy while requiring less than an order of magnitude fewer quantum circuit executions. We analyze the performance of the quantum kernel-based models in terms of the kernels’ induced feature spaces and explicitly construct their feature maps. Finally, we describe a scheme for approximating the best-performing quantum kernel using a classically-efficient tensor network representation of its input state and so provide a pathway for scaling this strategy to larger systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Alistair W.

It is intended to serve both as an introduction to Quantification Theory and as an exposition of new results and techniques in \"analytic\" or \"cut-free\" methods. We use the term \"analytic\" to apply to any proof procedure which obeys the subformula principle (we think of such a procedure as \"analysing\" the formula into its successive components). Gentzen cut-free systems are perhaps the best known example of ana lytic proof procedures. Natural deduction systems, though not usually analytic, can be made so (as we demonstrated in [3]). In this study, we emphasize the tableau point of view, since we are struck by its simplicity and mathematical elegance. Chapter I is completely introductory. We begin with preliminary material on trees (necessary for the tableau method), and then treat the basic syntactic and semantic fundamentals of propositional logic. We use the term \"Boolean valuation\" to mean any assignment of truth values to all formulas which satisfies the usual truth-table conditions for the logical connectives. Given an assignment of truth-values to all propositional variables, the truth-values of all other formulas under this assignment is usually defined by an inductive procedure.

  {"id":"sombillo2023","abstract":"We revisit the quantum correction to the classical time of arrival to address the unphysical instantaneous arrival in the limit of zero initial momentum. In this study, we show that the vanishing of arrival time is due to the contamination of the causality-violating component of the initial wave packet. Motivated by this observation, we propose to update the temporal collapse mechanism in [Galapon E. A. 2009, Proc. R. Soc. A.46571-86] to incorporate the removal of causality-violating spectra of the arrival time operator. We found that the quantum correction to the classical arrival time is still observed. Thus, our analysis validates that the correction is an inherent consequence of quantizing a time observable and is not just some mathematical artifact of the theory. We also discuss the possible application of the theory in describing point interactions in particle physics and provide a possible explanation to the observed neutron's lifetime anomaly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sombillo","given":"Denny Lane B."},{"family":"Sombillo","given":"Neris I."}],"citation-key":"sombillo2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.06949","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.06949","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Formulation of causality-preserving quantum time of arrival theory","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06949"},

The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high level of excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and rein force the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and to encourage the teaching of new courses.

  {"id":"sorensen2006","abstract":"The Curry-Howard isomorphism states an amazing correspondence between systems of formal logic as encountered in proof theory and computational calculi as found in type theory. For instance,minimal propositional logic corresponds to simply typed lambda-calculus, first-order logic corresponds to dependent types, second-order logic corresponds to polymorphic types, sequent calculus is related to explicit substitution, etc.The isomorphism has many aspects, even at the syntactic level:formulas correspond to types, proofs correspond to terms, provability corresponds to inhabitation, proof normalization corresponds to term reduction, etc.But there is more to the isomorphism than this. For instance, it is an old idea---due to Brouwer, Kolmogorov, and Heyting---that a constructive proof of an implication is a procedure that transformsproofs of the antecedent into proofs of the succedent; the Curry-Howard isomorphism gives syntactic representations of such procedures. The Curry-Howard isomorphism also provides theoretical foundations for many modern proof-assistant systems (e.g. Coq).This book give an introduction to parts of proof theory and related aspects of type theory relevant for the Curry-Howard isomorphism.

  {"id":"speliotopoulos2004","abstract":"The coupling of gravity to matter is explored in the linearized gravity limit. The usual derivation of gravity-matter couplings within the quantum-field-theoretic framework is reviewed. A number of inconsistencies between this derivation of the couplings, and the known results of tidal effects on test particles according to classical general relativity are pointed out. As a step towards resolving these inconsistencies, a General Laboratory Frame fixed on the worldline of an observer is constructed. In this frame, the dynamics of nonrelativistic test particles in the linearized gravity limit is studied, and their Hamiltonian dynamics is derived. It is shown that for stationary metrics this Hamiltonian reduces to the usual Hamiltonian for nonrelativistic particles undergoing geodesic motion. For nonstationary metrics with long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs) present, it reduces to the Hamiltonian for a nonrelativistic particle undergoing geodesic \\textit{deviation} motion. Arbitrary-wavelength GWs couple to the test particle through a vector-potential-like field $N_a$, the net result of the tidal forces that the GW induces in the system, namely, a local velocity field on the system induced by tidal effects as seen by an observer in the general laboratory frame. Effective electric and magnetic fields, which are related to the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, are constructed from $N_a$ that obey equations of the same form as Maxwell's equations .

This material is used to motivate the theory of martingales, and, after reaching a decent level of confidence with discrete processes, the course takes up the more de manding development of continuous-time stochastic processes, especially Brownian motion. The construction of Brownian motion is given in detail, and enough mate rial on the subtle nature of Brownian paths is developed for the student to evolve a good sense of when intuition can be trusted and when it cannot. The course then takes up the Ito integral in earnest. The development of stochastic integration aims to be careful and complete without being pedantic.","author":[{"family":"Steele","given":"J.

  {"id":"stein2003","abstract":"This first volume, a three-part introduction to the subject, is intended for students with a beginning knowledge of mathematical analysis who are motivated to discover the ideas that shape Fourier analysis. It begins with the simple conviction that Fourier arrived at in the early nineteenth century when studying problems in the physical sciences--that an arbitrary function can be written as an infinite sum of the most basic trigonometric functions. The first part implements this idea in terms of notions of convergence and summability of Fourier series, while highlighting applications such as the isoperimetric inequality and equidistribution. The second part deals with the Fourier transform and its applications to classical partial differential equations and the Radon transform; a clear introduction to the subject serves to avoid technical difficulties. The book closes with Fourier theory for finite abelian groups, which is applied to prime numbers in arithmetic progression. In organizing their exposition, the authors have carefully balanced an emphasis on key conceptual insights against the need to provide the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis. Students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences will find the theory and applications covered in this volume to be of real interest. The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them.

  {"id":"stein2010","abstract":"With this second volume, we enter the intriguing world of complex analysis. From the first theorems on, the elegance and sweep of the results is evident. The starting point is the simple idea of extending a function initially given for real values of the argument to one that is defined when the argument is complex. From there, one proceeds to the main properties of holomorphic functions, whose proofs are generally short and quite illuminating: the Cauchy theorems, residues, analytic continuation, the argument principle. With this background, the reader is ready to learn a wealth of additional material connecting the subject with other areas of mathematics: the Fourier transform treated by contour integration, the zeta function and the prime number theorem, and an introduction to elliptic functions culminating in their application to combinatorics and number theory.

  {"id":"stewart2015","abstract":"The transition from school mathematics to university mathematics is seldom straightforward. Students are faced with a disconnect between the algorithmic and informal attitude to mathematics at school, versus a new emphasis on proof, based on logic, and a more abstract development of general concepts, based on set theory.  The authors have many years' experience of the potential difficulties involved, through teaching first-year undergraduates and researching the ways in which students and mathematicians think. The book explains the motivation behind abstract foundational material based on students' experiences of school mathematics, and explicitly suggests ways students can make sense of formal ideas.  This second edition takes a significant step forward by not only making the transition from intuitive to formal methods, but also by reversing the process- using structure theorems to prove that formal systems have visual and symbolic interpretations that enhance mathematical thinking. This is exemplified by a new chapter on the theory of groups.  While the first edition extended counting to infinite cardinal numbers, the second also extends the real numbers rigorously to larger ordered fields. This links intuitive ideas in calculus to the formal epsilon-delta methods of analysis. The approach here is not the conventional one of 'nonstandard analysis', but a simpler, graphically based treatment which makes the notion of an infinitesimal natural and straightforward.  This allows a further vision of the wider world of mathematical thinking in which formal definitions and proof lead to amazing new ways of defining, proving, visualising and symbolising mathematics beyond previous expectations.","author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Tall","given":"David Orme"}],"citation-key":"stewart2015","ISBN":"978-0-19-870643-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"409","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Foundations of Mathematics","type":"book"},

Rather than starting from the Dirac-Von Neumann axioms, the book offers a short presentation of the mathematical structure of QM using the C--algebraic structure of the observable based on the operational definition of measurements and the duality between states and observables. The description of states and observables as Hilbert space vectors and operators is then derived from the GNS and Gelfand-Naimark Theorems.For finite degrees of freedom, the Weyl algebra codifies the experimental limitations on the measurements of position and momentum (Heisenberg uncertainty relations) and Schroedinger QM follows from the von Neumann uniqueness theorem.The existence problem of the dynamics is related to the self-adjointness of the differential operator describing the Hamiltonian and solved by the Rellich-Kato theorems. Examples are discussed which include the explanation of the discreteness of the atomic spectra.Because of the increasing interest in the relation between QM and stochastic processes, a final chapter is devoted to the functional integral approach (Feynman-Kac formula), the formulation in terms of ground state correlations (Wightman functions) and their analytic continuation to imaginary time (Euclidean QM).

  {"id":"strocchi2013","abstract":"Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has proved to be the most useful strategy for the description of elementary particle interactions and as such is regarded as a fundamental part of modern theoretical physics. In most presentations, the emphasis is on the effectiveness of the theory in producing experimentally testable predictions, which at present essentially means Perturbative QFT. However, after more than fifty years of QFT, we still are in the embarrassing situation of not knowing a single non-trivial (even non-realistic) model of QFT in 3+1 dimensions, allowing a non-perturbative control. As a reaction to these consistency problems one may take the position that they are related to our ignorance of the physics of small distances and that QFT is only an effective theory, so that radically new ideas are needed for a consistent quantum theory of relativistic interactions (in 3+1 dimensions). The book starts by discussing the conflict between locality or hyperbolicity and positivity of the energy for relativistic wave equations, which marks the origin of quantum field theory, and the mathematical problems of the perturbative expansion (canonical quantization, interaction picture, non-Fock representation, asymptotic convergence of the series etc.). The general physical principles of positivity of the energy, Poincare' covariance and locality provide a substitute for canonical quantization, qualify the non-perturbative foundation and lead to very relevant results, like the Spin-statistics theorem, TCP symmetry, a substitute for canonical quantization, non-canonical behaviour, the euclidean formulation at the basis of the functional integral approach, the non-perturbative definition of the S-matrix (LSZ, Haag-Ruelle-Buchholz theory). A characteristic feature of gauge field theories is Gauss' law constraint. It is responsible for the conflict between locality of the charged fields and positivity, it yields the superselection of the (unbroken) gauge charges, provides a non-perturbative explanation of the Higgs mechanism in the local gauges, implies the infraparticle structure of the charged particles in QED and the breaking of the Lorentz group in the charged sectors. A non-perturbative proof of the Higgs mechanism is discussed in the Coulomb gauge: the vector bosons corresponding to the broken generators are massive and their two point function dominates the Goldstone spectrum, thus excluding the occurrence of massless Goldstone bosons. The solution of the U(1) problem in QCD, the theta vacuum structure and the inevitable breaking of the chiral symmetry in each theta sector are derived solely from the topology of the gauge group, without relying on the semiclassical instanton approximation.","author":[{"family":"Strocchi","given":"Franco"}],"citation-key":"strocchi2013","ISBN":"978-0-19-967157-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,14]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"270","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"An Introduction to Non-Perturbative Foundations of Quantum Field Theory","type":"book"},

This approach will give you a solid foundation for writing useful, correct, maintainable, and efficient code.    Programming with Today’s C++ (C++11 and C++14)  The book is an introduction to programming in general, including object-oriented programming and generic programming. It is also a solid introduction to the C++ programming language, one of the most widely used languages for real-world software. The book presents modern C++ programming techniques from the start, introducing the C++ standard library and C++11 and C++14 features to simplify programming tasks.    For Beginners—And Anyone Who Wants to Learn Something New  The book is primarily designed for people who have never programmed before, and it has been tested with many thousands of first-year university students. It has also been extensively used for self-study. Also, practitioners and advanced students have gained new insight and guidance by seeing how a master approaches the elements of his art.    Provides a Broad View  The first half of the book covers a wide range of essential concepts, design and programming techniques, language features, and libraries. Those will enable you to write programs involving input, output, computation, and simple graphics. The second half explores more specialized topics (such as text processing, testing, and the C programming language) and provides abundant reference material. Source code and support supplements are available from the author’s website.","author":[{"family":"Stroustrup","given":"Bjarne"}],"citation-key":"stroustrup2014","ISBN":"978-0-13-379674-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,2]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1312","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","source":"Google Books","title":"Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++","title-short":"Programming","type":"book"},

Piron's theorem combines abstract projective geometry with lattice theory. In fact, throughout this chapter we present the basic lattice theoretic aspects of abstract projective geometry: we prove the categorical equivalence of projective geometries and projective lattices, and the triple categorical equivalence of Hilbert geometries, Hilbert lattices and propositional systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Stubbe","given":"Isar"},{"family":"Van Steirteghem","given":"Bart"}],"citation-key":"stubbe2007","container-title":"arXiv.org","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.0710.2098","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,10]]},"language":"en","title":"Propositional systems, Hilbert lattices and generalized Hilbert spaces","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.2098v1"},

We identify a set of physical conditions imposed on the system dynamics, that, when satisfied, lead to the aforementioned trajectory interpretation of the measurement results. Then, we show that when another quantum system is coupled to the observable, the operator representing it can be replaced by an external noise. Crucially, the realizations of this surrogate (classical) stochastic process are following the same trajectories as those measured by the observer.

While we do not solve the, expectedly, rich representation theory completely, we present a, to the best of our knowledge, new, non-trivial solution to the representation problem. This solution exists (1) for any target space dimension, (2) for Minkowski signature of the target space, (3) without tachyons, (4) manifestly ghost free (no negative norm states), (5) without fixing a worldsheet or target space gauge, (6) without (Virasoro) anomalies (zero central charge), (7) while preserving manifest target space Poincaré invariance and (8) without picking up UV divergences. The existence of this stable solution is, on one hand, exciting because it raises the hope that among all the solutions to the representation problem (including fermionic degrees of freedom) we find stable, phenomenologically acceptable ones in lower dimensional target spaces, possibly without supersymmetry, that are much simpler than the solutions that arise via compactification of the standard Fock representation of the string. On the other hand, if such solutions are found, then this would prove that neither a critical dimension (D = 10, 11, 26) nor supersymmetry is a prediction of string theory. Rather, these would be features of the particular Fock representation of current string theory and hence would not be generic. The solution presented in this paper exploits the flatness of the target space in several important ways. In a companion paper, we treat the more complicated case of curved target spaces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Thiemann","given":"T."}],"citation-key":"thiemann2006","container-title":"Classical and Quantum Gravity","container-title-short":"Class.

  {"id":"thiemannModernCanonicalQuantum2008","abstract":"Modern physics rests on two fundamental building blocks: general relativity and quantum theory. General relativity is a geometric interpretation of gravity while quantum theory governs the microscopic behaviour of matter. Since matter is described by quantum theory which in turn couples to geometry, we need a quantum theory of gravity. In order to construct quantum gravity one must reformulate quantum theory on a background independent way. Modern Canonical Quantum General Relativity provides a complete treatise of the canonical quantisation of general relativity. The focus is on detailing the conceptual and mathematical framework, on describing physical applications and on summarising the status of this programme in its most popular incarnation, called loop quantum gravity. Mathematical concepts and their relevance to physics are provided within this book, which therefore can be read by graduate students with basic knowledge of quantum field theory or general relativity.","author":[{"family":"Thiemann","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"thiemannModernCanonicalQuantum2008","ISBN":"978-1-139-46759-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11,13]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"739","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Modern Canonical Quantum General Relativity","type":"book"},
  {"id":"tilly2022","abstract":"The variational quantum eigensolver (or VQE), first developed by Peruzzo et al. (2014), has received significant attention from the research community in recent years. It uses the variational principle to compute the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian, a problem that is central to quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Conventional computing methods are constrained in their accuracy due to the computational limits facing exact modeling of the exponentially growing electronic wavefunction for these many-electron systems. The VQE may be used to model these complex wavefunctions in polynomial time, making it one of the most promising near-term applications for quantum computing. One important advantage is that variational algorithms have been shown to present some degree of resilience to the noise in the quantum hardware. Finding a path to navigate the relevant literature has rapidly become an overwhelming task, with many methods promising to improve different parts of the algorithm, but without clear descriptions of how the diverse parts fit together. The potential practical advantages of the algorithm are also widely discussed in the literature, but with varying conclusions. Despite strong theoretical underpinnings suggesting excellent scaling of individual VQE components, studies have pointed out that their various pre-factors could be too large to reach a quantum computing advantage over conventional methods. This review aims at disentangling the relevant literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the progress that has been made on the different parts of the algorithm, and to discuss future areas of research that are fundamental for the VQE to deliver on its promises. All the different components of the algorithm are reviewed in detail. These include the representation of Hamiltonians and wavefunctions on a quantum computer, the optimization process to find ground state energies, the post processing mitigation of quantum errors, and suggested best practices. We identify four main areas of future research: (1) optimal measurement schemes for reduction of circuit repetitions required; (2) large scale parallelization across many quantum computers; (3) ways to overcome the potential appearance of vanishing gradients in the optimization process for large systems, and how the number of iterations required for the optimization scales with system size; (4) the extent to which VQE suffers for quantum noise, and whether this noise can be mitigated in a tractable manner. The answers to these open research questions will determine the routes for the VQE to achieve quantum advantage as the quantum computing hardware scales up and as the noise levels are reduced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tilly","given":"Jules"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hongxiang"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Shuxiang"},{"family":"Picozzi","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Setia","given":"Kanav"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Grant","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Wossnig","given":"Leonard"},{"family":"Rungger","given":"Ivan"},{"family":"Booth","given":"George H."},{"family":"Tennyson","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"tilly2022","collection-title":"The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: a review of methods and best practices","container-title":"Physics Reports","container-title-short":"Physics Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.physrep.2022.08.003","ISSN":"0370-1573","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,5]]},"language":"en","page":"1-128","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A review of methods and best practices","title-short":"The Variational Quantum Eigensolver","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157322003118","volume":"986"},

We argue that this \"failure\" is actually an inherent feature of any quantum description that attempts to incorporate the equivalence principle exactly within quantum dynamics. In the second part, we speculate on how an exact realization of the equivalence principle might be implemented in an effective quantum field theory via the general covariance of correlators.

Recently, higher dimensional qudits - in particular, qutrits - have gained prominence within quantum computing research. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of efficient rewrite strategies for the stabiliser fragment of the qutrit ZX-calculus. Notably, this constitutes a first non-trivial step towards the simplification of qutrit quantum circuits.

One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given.

  {"id":"valle-perez2019","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit. While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit. In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks applied to CIFAR10 and MNIST. As the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems. This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than the more conventional prior over parameter space. If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets. By exploiting recently discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood, we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Valle-Pérez","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Camargo","given":"Chico Q."},{"family":"Louis","given":"Ard A."}],"citation-key":"valle-perez2019","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1805.08522","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,21]]},"number":"arXiv:1805.08522","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Deep learning generalizes because the parameter-function map is biased towards simple functions","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08522"},

It targets a wide range of chemical environments, including the gas phase, interfaces, and the condensed phase. These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i.e., have a small (down to 0.2kcal∕mol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0.1D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for linear scaling calculations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"VandeVondele","given":"Joost"},{"family":"Hutter","given":"Jürg"}],"citation-key":"vandevondele2007","container-title":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","container-title-short":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.2770708","ISSN":"0021-9606","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,18]]},"page":"114105","source":"Silverchair","title":"Gaussian basis sets for accurate calculations on molecular systems in gas and condensed phases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2770708","volume":"127"},

It provides a computational model equivalent to the Turing machine, and continues to be of enormous benefit in the classical theory of computation. We propose that quantum computation, like its classical counterpart, may benefit from a version of the lambda calculus suitable for expressing and reasoning about quantum algorithms. In this paper we develop a quantum lambda calculus as an alternative model of quantum computation, which combines some of the benefits of both the quantum Turing machine and the quantum circuit models. The calculus turns out to be closely related to the linear lambda calculi used in the study of Linear Logic. We set up a computational model and an equational proof system for this calculus, and we argue that it is equivalent to the quantum Turing machine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Tonder","given":"Andre","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vantonder2004","container-title":"SIAM Journal on Computing","container-title-short":"SIAM J.

  {"id":"varadarajan2006","abstract":"Euler is one of the greatest and most prolific mathematicians of all time. He wrote the first accessible books on calculus, created the theory of circular functions, and discovered new areas of research such as elliptic integrals, the calculus of variations, graph theory, divergent series, and so on. It took hundreds of years for his successors to develop in full the theories he began, and some of his themes are still at the center of today's mathematics. It is of great interesttherefore to examine his work and its relation to current mathematics. This book attempts to do that. In number theory the discoveries he made empirically would require for their eventual understanding such sophisticated developments as the reciprocity laws and class field theory. His pioneering work onelliptic integrals is the precursor of the modern theory of abelian functions and abelian integrals. His evaluation of zeta and multizeta values is not only a fantastic and exciting story but very relevant to us, because they are at the confluence of much research in algebraic geometry and number theory today (Chapters 2 and 3 of the book). Anticipating his successors by more than a century, Euler created a theory of summation of series that do not converge in the traditional manner. Chapter 5of the book treats the progression of ideas regarding divergent series from Euler to many parts of modern analysis and quantum physics. The last chapter contains a brief treatment of Euler products. Euler discovered the product formula over the primes for the zeta function as well as for a smallnumber of what are now called Dirichlet $L$-functions. Here the book goes into the development of the theory of such Euler products and the role they play in number theory, thus offering the reader a glimpse of current developments (the Langlands program).","author":[{"family":"Varadarajan","given":"V.

It is my hope that this book will introduce the aspiring graduate student as well as the nonspecialist mathematician to the fundamental themes of the subject. I have made no attempt to discuss infinite-dimensional representations. This is a very active field, and a proper treatment of it would require another volume (if not more) of this size.

  {"id":"voglSpeedMarkovianRelaxation2010","abstract":"For sufficiently low reservoir temperatures, it is known that open quantum systems subject to decoherent interactions with the reservoir relax towards their ground state in the weak coupling limit. Within the framework of quantum master equations, this is formalized by the Born-Markov-secular (BMS) approximation, where one obtains the system Gibbs state with the reservoir temperature as a stationary state. When the solution to some problem is encoded in the (isolated) ground state of a system Hamiltonian, decoherence can therefore be exploited for computation. The computational complexity is then given by the scaling of the relaxation time with the system size $n$. We study the relaxation behavior for local and non-local Hamiltonians that are coupled dissipatively with local and non-local operators to a bosonic bath in thermal equilibrium. We find that relaxation is generally more efficient when coherences of the density matrix in the system energy eigenbasis are taken into account. In addition, the relaxation speed strongly depends on the matrix elements of the coupling operators between initial state and ground state. We show that Dicke superradiance is a special case of our relaxation models and can thus be understood as a coherence-assisted relaxation speedup.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Vogl","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Schaller","given":"Gernot"},{"family":"Brandes","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"voglSpeedMarkovianRelaxation2010","container-title":"Physical Review A","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"voight2021","abstract":"This open access textbook presents a comprehensive treatment of the arithmetic theory of quaternion algebras and orders, a subject with applications in diverse areas of mathematics. Written to be accessible and approachable to the graduate student reader, this text collects and synthesizes results from across the literature. Numerous pathways offer explorations in many different directions, while the unified treatment makes this book an essential reference for students and researchers alike. Divided into five parts, the book begins with a basic introduction to the noncommutative algebra underlying the theory of quaternion algebras over fields, including the relationship to quadratic forms. An in-depth exploration of the arithmetic of quaternion algebras and orders follows. The third part considers analytic aspects, starting with zeta functions and then passing to an idelic approach, offering a pathway from local to global that includes strong approximation. Applications of unit groups of quaternion orders to hyperbolic geometry and low-dimensional topology follow, relating geometric and topological properties to arithmetic invariants. Arithmetic geometry completes the volume, including quaternionic aspects of modular forms, supersingular elliptic curves, and the moduli of QM abelian surfaces. Quaternion Algebras encompasses a vast wealth of knowledge at the intersection of many fields. Graduate students interested in algebra, geometry, and number theory will appreciate the many avenues and connections to be explored. Instructors will find numerous options for constructing introductory and advanced courses, while researchers will value the all-embracing treatment. Readers are assumed to have some familiarity with algebraic number theory and commutative algebra, as well as the fundamentals of linear algebra, topology, and complex analysis.

In this approach, information is stored in the lowest energy states of many-anyon systems and processed by braiding non-abelian anyons.

Besides its theoretical esthetic appeal, the practical merit of the topological approach lies in its error-minimizing hypothetical hardware: topological phases of matter are fault-avoiding or deaf to most local noises, and unitary gates are implemented with exponential accuracy. Experimental realizations are pursued in systems such as fractional quantum Hall liquids and topological insulators.

In the last twenty years, however, there has been the emergence of a new paradigm associated with fractionalisation, topological order, emergent gauge bosons and fermions, and string condensation. These new physical concepts are so fundamental that they may even influence our understanding of the origin of light and fermions in the universe. This book is a pedagogical and systematic introduction to the new concepts and quantum field theoretical methods (which have fuelled the rapid developments) in condensed matter physics. It discusses many basic notions in theoretical physics which underlie physical phenomena in nature. Topics covered are dissipative quantum systems, boson condensation, symmetry breaking and gapless excitations, phase transitions, Fermi liquids, spin density wave states, Fermi and fractional statistics, quantum Hall effects, topological and quantum order, spin liquids, and string condensation. Methods covered are the path integral, Green's functions, mean-field theory, effective theory, renormalization group, bosonization in one- and higher dimensions, non-linear sigma-model, quantum gauge theory, dualities, slave-boson theory, and exactly soluble models beyond one-dimension.

From a computer scientist’s perspective we would like to study quantum theory in a way that allows interesting transformations and compositions of systems and that also includes infinitedimensional datatypes. Here we present such a compositional reconstruction of quantum theory that includes infinite-dimensional systems. This reconstruction is noteworthy for three reasons: it is only one of a few that includes no restrictions on the dimension of a system; it allows for both classical, quantum, and mixed systems; and it makes no a priori reference to the structure of the real (or complex) numbers.

  {"id":"wetering2019","abstract":"An often used model for quantum theory is to associate to every physical system a C*-algebra. From a physical point of view it is unclear why operator algebras would form a good description of nature. In this paper, we find a set of physically meaningful assumptions such that any physical theory satisfying these assumptions must embed into the category of finite-dimensional C*-algebras. These assumptions were originally introduced in the setting of effectus theory, a categorical logical framework generalizing classical and quantum logic. As these assumptions have a physical interpretation, this motivates the usage of operator algebras as a model for quantum theory. In contrast to other reconstructions of quantum theory, we do not start with the framework of generalized probabilistic theories and instead use effect theories where no convex structure and no tensor product needs to be present. The lack of this structure in effectus theory has led to a different notion of pure maps. A map in an effectus is pure when it is a composition of a compression and a filter. These maps satisfy particular universal properties and respectively correspond to `forgetting' and `measuring' the validity of an effect. We define a pure effect theory (PET) to be an effect theory where the pure maps form a dagger-category and filters and compressions are adjoint. We show that any convex finite-dimensional PET must embed into the category of Euclidean Jordan algebras. Moreover, if the PET also has monoidal structure, then we show that it must embed into either the category of real or complex C*-algebras, which completes our reconstruction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Wetering","given":"John","dropping-particle":"van de"}],"citation-key":"wetering2019","container-title":"Compositionality","DOI":"10.32408/compositionality-1-1","ISSN":"2631-4444","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,18]]},"publisher":"Episciences.org","source":"compositionality.episciences.org","title":"An effect-theoretic reconstruction of quantum theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://compositionality.episciences.org/13504","volume":"Volume 1 (2019)"},

Using basic concepts from algebra, he examines the various properties of the groups. Analysis and topology are used wherever appropriate. The book also covers topics such as matrix algebras, semigroups, commutators, and spinors, which are of great importance in understanding the group-theoretic structure of quantum mechanics. Hermann Weyl was among the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. He made fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, but he is best remembered as one of the major developers of group theory, a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present. In The Classical Groups, his most important book, Weyl provided a detailed introduction to the development of group theory, and he did it in a way that motivated and entertained his readers. Departing from most theoretical mathematics books of the time, he introduced historical events and people as well as theorems and proofs. One learned not only about the theory of invariants but also when and where they were originated, and by whom. He once said of his writing, \"My work always tried to unite the truth with the beautiful, but when I had to choose one or the other, I usually chose the beautiful.\" Weyl believed in the overall unity of mathematics and that it should be integrated into other fields. He had serious interest in modern physics, especially quantum mechanics, a field to which The Classical Groups has proved important, as it has to quantum chemistry and other fields. Among the five books Weyl published with Princeton, Algebraic Theory of Numbers inaugurated the Annals of Mathematics Studies book series, a crucial and enduring foundation of Princeton's mathematics list and the most distinguished book series in mathematics.","author":[{"family":"Weyl","given":"Hermann"}],"citation-key":"weyl2016","ISBN":"978-1-4008-8390-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,2]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"336","publisher":"Princeton University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and Representations (PMS-1)","title-short":"The Classical Groups","type":"book"},

These form a non-Boolean—inparticular, non-distributive—orthocomplemented lattice.Quantum-mechanical states correspond exactly to probability measures(suitably defined) on this lattice., What are we to make of this? Some have argued that the empiricalsuccess of quantum mechanics calls for a revolution in logic itself.This view is associated with the demand for a realistic interpretationof quantum mechanics, i.e., one not grounded in any primitive notionof measurement. Against this, there is a long tradition ofinterpreting quantum mechanics operationally, that is, as beingprecisely a theory of measurement. On this latter view, it is notsurprising that a “logic” of measurement-outcomes, in asetting where not all measurements are compatible, should prove not tobe Boolean. Rather, the mystery is why it should have theparticular non-Boolean structure that it does in quantummechanics.

  {"id":"wise2010","abstract":"The geometric content of the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity is best understood in terms of Cartan geometry. In particular, Cartan geometry gives clear geometric meaning to the MacDowell-Mansouri trick of combining the Levi-Civita connection and coframe field, or soldering form, into a single physical field. The Cartan perspective allows us to view physical spacetime as tangentially approximated by an arbitrary homogeneous \"model spacetime\", including not only the flat Minkowski model, as is implicitly used in standard general relativity, but also de Sitter, anti de Sitter, or other models. A \"Cartan connection\" gives a prescription for parallel transport from one \"tangent model spacetime\" to another, along any path, giving a natural interpretation of the MacDowell-Mansouri connection as \"rolling\" the model spacetime along physical spacetime. I explain Cartan geometry, and \"Cartan gauge theory\", in which the gauge field is replaced by a Cartan connection. In particular, I discuss MacDowell-Mansouri gravity, as well as its more recent reformulation in terms of BF theory, in the context of Cartan geometry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wise","given":"Derek K."}],"citation-key":"wise2010","container-title":"Classical and Quantum Gravity","container-title-short":"Class.

Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\\times {\\bf S}^5$ match with the chiral operators of $\\N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions.

However, the number of state amplitudes required for full simulation increases exponentially with the number of qubits. In this study, we leverage data compression to reduce memory requirements, trading computation time and fidelity for memory space. Specifically, we develop a hybrid solution by combining the lossless compression and our tailored lossy compression method with adaptive error bounds at each timestep of the simulation. Our approach optimizes for compression speed and makes sure that errors due to lossy compression are uncorrelated, an important property for comparing simulation output with physical machines. Experiments show that our approach reduces the memory requirement of simulating the 61-qubit Grover's search algorithm from 32 exabytes to 768 terabytes of memory on Argonne's Theta supercomputer using 4,096 nodes.

There are several theoretical prescriptions of quantum dissipation but none of them is simple enough to be treated exactly in real applications. As a result, formulations in different prescriptions are practically used with different approximation schemes. This review examines both theoretical and application aspects on various perturbative formulations, especially those that are exact up to second-order but nonequivalent in high-order system-bath coupling contributions. Discrimination is made in favor of an unconventional formulation that in a sense combines the merits of both the conventional time-local and memory-kernel prescriptions, where the latter is least favorite in terms of the applicability range of parameters for system-bath coupling, non-Markovian, and temperature. Also highlighted is the importance of correlated driving and disspation effects, not only on the dynamics under strong external field driving, but also in the calculation of field-free correlation and response functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"YiJing"},{"family":"Xu","given":"RuiXue"}],"citation-key":"yan2005","container-title":"Annual Review of Physical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Annu.

Furthermore, with the widespread use of high-speed and large-capacity computers as the background, it is felt necessary in recent years to derive a global solution for nonlinear and multipeaked optimization problems. It is one of the most important topics in optimization. This paper proposes a new dynamic tunneling algorithm with multitrajectories (Multitrajectory Dynamic Tunneling Algorithm) that is composed of two systems, an optimization system and a tunneling system. The numerical stability of the conventional dynamic tunneling algorithm is theoretically investigated and interaction between each trajectory of the tunneling system is introduced in order to improve search efficiency.

We show that the effect is present even for simple states consisting of superpositions of gaussian wave packets, although the size of the effect is small. Inspired by the numerical results of Penz et al, we present a wave function whose current at any time may be computed analytically and which has periods of significant backflow, with a backwards flux equal to about 70 percent of the maximum possible backflow, a dimensionless number cbm ≈ 0.04, discovered by Bracken and Melloy. This number has the unusual property of being independent of ℏ (and also of all other parameters of the model), despite corresponding to a quantum-mechanical effect, and we shed some light on this surprising property by considering the classical limit of backflow.

The goal of this book is to introduce these techniques and show how they lead to a new systematic way of characterizing and classifying quantum phases in condensed matter systems.   The first part of the book introduces some basic concepts in quantum information theory which are then used to study the central topic explained in Part II: local Hamiltonians and their ground states. Part III focuses on one of the major new phenomena in strongly interacting systems, the topological order, and shows how it can essentially be defined and characterized in terms of entanglement. Part IV shows that the key entanglement structure of topological states can be captured using the tensor network representation, which provides a powerful tool in the classification of quantum phases. Finally, Part V discusses the exciting prospect at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter physics – the unification of information and matter.

  {"id":"zheng2023","abstract":"Quantum error detection has been an experimental focus on early fault-tolerant quantum hardware. However, it requires multiple mid-circuit measurements to extract the syndrome and the readout-induced noise acts as a main contribution to the state infidelity. We present a novel method named Generalized Syndrome Measurement for quantum error detection that only requires a single-shot measurement on a single ancilla, while the canonical syndrome measurement needs to measure multiple times to extract the syndrome for each stabilizer generator. Our method minimizes the readout-induced noise by using single-shot measurements with a tolerable overhead on the gate complexity. We simulated the performance of our method using [[4, 2, 2]] and [[5, 1, 3]] code under realistic noise, and our method outperforms the canonical method when the gate error is comparatively small than the readout error. As mid-circuit measurements are more costly for various kinds of near-term scalable quantum hardware, our method can significantly boost the development of early fault-tolerant quantum computing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Yunzhe"},{"family":"Kanno","given":"Keita"}],"citation-key":"zheng2023","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,23]]},"language":"en","title":"Quantum Error Detection with Generalized Syndrome Measurement","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11532v1"},

Applications of this theory can be found, for example, in artificial intelligence, computer science, medicine, control engineering, decision theory, expert systems, logic, management science, operations research, pattern recognition, and robotics. Mathematical developments have advanced to a very high standard and are still forthcoming to day. In this review, the basic mathematical framework of fuzzy set theory will be described, as well as the most important applications of this theory to other theories and techniques. Since 1992 fuzzy set theory, the theory of neural nets and the area of evolutionary programming have become known under the name of ‘computational intelligence’ or ‘soft computing’. The relationship between these areas has naturally become particularly close. In this review, however, we will focus primarily on fuzzy set theory. Applications of fuzzy set theory to real problems are abound. Some references will be given. To describe even a part of them would certainly exceed the scope of this review.

  {"id":"zinn-justin2007","abstract":"This work tries to provide an elementary introduction to the notions of continuum limit and universality in statistical systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. The existence of a continuum limit requires the appearance of correlations at large distance, a situation that is encountered in second order phase transitions, near the critical temperature. In this context, we will emphasize the role of gaussian distributions and their relations with the mean field approximation and Landau's theory of critical phenomena. We will show that quasi-gaussian or mean-field approximations cannot describe correctly phase transitions in three space dimensions. We will assign this difficulty to the coupling of very different physical length scales, even though the systems we will consider have only local, that is, short range interactions. To analyze the unusual situation, a new concept is required: the renormalization group, whose fixed points allow understanding the universality of physical properties at large distance, beyond mean-field theory. In the continuum limit, critical phenomena can be described by quantum field theories. In this framework, the renormalization group is directly related to the renormalization process, that is, the necessity to cancel the infinities that arise in straightforward formulations of the theory. We thus discuss the renormalization group in the context of various relevant field theories. This leads to proofs of universality and to efficient tools for calculating universal quantities in a perturbative framework. Finally, we construct a general functional renormalization group, which can be used when perturbative methods are inadequate.","author":[{"family":"Zinn-Justin","given":"Jean"}],"citation-key":"zinn-justin2007","ISBN":"978-0-19-922719-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",7,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"465","publisher":"OUP Oxford","source":"Google Books","title":"Phase Transitions and Renormalization Group","type":"book"},

  {"id":"zurek2022","abstract":"This short review is intended as a colloquium-level summary, for the Snowmass 2021 process, on recent theoretical results on infrared observables in quantum gravity. We rely on simple physical arguments, most notably a random walk intuition, to show how effects of quantum gravity in the ultraviolet (at the Planck length $\\ell_p \\approx 10^{-35} \\mbox{ m}$) may integrate into the infrared when the large measurement length scale $L$ enters into the observable. A quantum uncertainty at lightsheet horizons would give rise to an accumulated effect of size $\\delta L^2 \\simeq \\ell_p L/4 \\pi$. We discuss how the random walk intuition falls out from more formal calculations, such as from AdS/CFT, from the dimensional reduction of the Einstein-Hilbert action to dilaton gravity, from multiple gravitational shockwaves generated by vacuum energy fluctuations, as well as from an effective description of gravity as a fluid. We overview experimental prospects for measuring this effect with a simple Michelson interferometer utilizing many of the tools developed for gravitational wave observatories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurek","given":"Kathryn M."}],"citation-key":"zurek2022","container-title":"arXiv:2205.01799 [gr-qc, physics:hep-ph, physics:hep-th]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Snowmass 2021 White Paper: Observational Signatures of Quantum Gravity","title-short":"Snowmass 2021 White Paper","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01799"},

The higher genus algebraic structure implies the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) master equation and thus consistent BRST quantization of the quantum action. From the L∞ algebra, and the BV equation on the off-shell state space we derive the L∞ algebra, and the BV equation on physical states that were recently constructed in d = 2 string theory. The string diagrams are surfaces with minimal area metrics, foliated by closed geodesics of length 2π. These metrics generalize quadratic differentials in that foliation bands can cross. The string vertices are succinctly characterized; they include the surfaces whose foliation bands are all of height smaller than 2π.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Zwiebach","given":"Barton"}],"citation-key":"zwiebach1993","container-title":"Nuclear Physics B","container-title-short":"Nuclear Physics B","DOI":"10.1016/0550-3213(93)90388-6","ISSN":"0550-3213","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",1,25]]},"page":"33-152","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Closed string field theory: Quantum action and the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation","title-short":"Closed string field theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321393903886","volume":"390"},
