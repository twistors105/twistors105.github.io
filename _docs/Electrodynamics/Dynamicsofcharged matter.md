Given the dissipation equation in [Energy-momentum tensor of electrodynamics](https://www.notion.so/Energy-momentum-tensor-of-electrodynamics-971615b331b347828cc038a9cdcee9ca) the dynamics of the charged matter is determined by imposing the conservation of the total energy-momentum tensor $$T^{ab} + T_{\text{matter}}^{ab}$$. This can be done by imposing the equations of motion on the charged matter

$$\partial_{a} T^{ab}_{\text{matter}}=-j_{a} F^{ab}.$$

The detailed form of the equations of motion depends on the form of $$T^{ab}_{\text{matter}}$$. 

For instance, an isolated single particle system has its energy-momentum tensor as 

$$T^{ab}_{\text{matter}} = \frac{p^{a}(t) p^{b}(t)}{p^{0}(t)}\delta^{(3)}(x - x(t))$$

where $$t = x^{0}$$ and $$x$$ denotes $$x^{i},\ i = 1,2,3$$. It is then straightforward to show that the equations of motion for the charged particle is given by

$$\partial_{t} p^{b} = - j_{a} F^{ab}$$

which is the well-known Lorentz force.
